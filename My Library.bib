  abstract = {To improve cell attachment and to understand the effects of positive charge on the behavior of osteoblasts, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl-trimethylammonium chloride (MAETAC), a positively charged monomer, was incorporated into poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel. The physicochemical properties of the resultant polymers, including the degree of acrylation of PEGDA, pKa of MAETAC, swelling ratio, zeta potential, and protein adsorption were investigated. Meanwhile, osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on the hydrogel to evaluate the effect of the positive charge on the behavior of the cells, including attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. The results revealed that PEGDA was synthesized with 90 percent of acrylation and MAETAC had been successfully incorporated into PEGDA. The pKa value of MAETAC was 9.4 determined by acid-based titration. The electrically charged nature of modified hydrogels was confirmed by zeta potential. With increasing concentration of MAETAC, the swelling ratio of the hydrogel in deionized water increased, while the swelling ratio stayed constant in phosphate buffer solution. The protein adsorption of the hydrogel also increased with increasing concentration of MAETAC. The modification of positive charge not only enhanced the attachment and proliferation of osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells on the hydrogel, but also up-regulated alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells as well as gene expression of focal adhesion kinase and osteogenic markers, including collagen I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. These findings indicate that the positively charged PEGDA may not only be a promising scaffold candidate for bone tissue engineering, but also a good platform to study the effect of positive charge on cell behavior due to the controllable charge density.}

  abstract = {Cyanobacterial carboxysomes encapsulate carbonic anhydrase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). Genetic deletion of the major structural proteins encoded within the ccm operon in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (ΔccmKLMN) disrupts carboxysome formation and significantly affects cellular physiology. Here we employed both metabolite pool size analysis and isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) to examine metabolic regulation in cells lacking carboxysomes. Under high CO 2 environments (1\%), the ΔccmKLMN mutant could recover growth and had a similar central flux distribution as the control strain, with the exceptions of moderately decreased photosynthesis and elevated biomass protein content and photorespiration activity. Metabolite analyses indicated that the ΔccmKLMN strain had significantly larger pool sizes of pyruvate ({$>$}18 folds), UDPG (uridine diphosphate glucose), and aspartate as well as higher levels of secreted organic acids (e.g., malate and succinate). These results suggest that the ΔccmKLMN mutant is able to largely maintain a fluxome similar to the control strain by changing in intracellular metabolite concentrations and metabolite overflows under optimal growth conditions. When CO 2 was insufficient (0.2\%), provision of acetate moderately promoted mutant growth. Interestingly, the removal of microcompartments may loosen the flux network and promote RuBisCO side-reactions, facilitating redirection of central metabolites to competing pathways (i.e., pyruvate to heterologous lactate production). This study provides important insights into metabolic regulation via enzyme compartmentation and cyanobacterial compensatory responses.},

  abstract = {In plants, a limited capacity to utilize or export the end-products of the Calvin-Benson cycle (CB) from photosynthetically active source cells to non-photosynthetic sink cells can result in reduced carbon capture and photosynthetic electron transport (PET), and lowered photochemical efficiency. The down-regulation of photosynthesis caused by reduced capacity to utilize photosynthate has been termed 'sink limitation'. Recently, several cyanobacterial and algal strains engineered to overproduce target metabolites have exhibited increased photochemistry, suggesting that possible source-sink regulatory mechanisms may be involved. We directly examined photochemical properties following induction of a heterologous sucrose 'sink' in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We show that total photochemistry increases proportionally to the experimentally controlled rate of sucrose export. Importantly, the quantum yield of PSII (ΦII) increases in response to sucrose export while the PET chain becomes more oxidized from less PSI acceptor-side limitation, suggesting increased CB activity and a decrease in sink limitation. Enhanced photosynthetic activity and linear electron flow are detectable within hours of induction of the heterologous sink and are independent of pigmentation alterations or the ionic/osmotic effects of the induction system. These observations provide direct evidence that secretion of heterologous carbon bioproducts can be used as an alternative approach to improve photosynthetic efficiency, presumably by by-passing sink limitation. Our results also suggest that engineered microalgal production strains are valuable alternative models for examining photosynthetic sink limitation because they enable greater control and monitoring of metabolite fluxes relative to plants.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are microbes with high photosynthetic efficiencies, making them a promising target for the production of sustainable bioproducts directly from solar energy and carbon dioxide. The most common efforts to increase cyanobacterial bioproduction involve diverting cellular resources away from cellular biomass and towards a heterologous pathway, for example through nutrient starvation or knockout of genes in competing metabolic pathways. Here we show that an inducible cell growth arrest switch can be used to increase the partitioning of carbon to an engineered sucrose sink. Specifically, we show that overexpression of Regulator of Phycobilisome-Associated B (RpaB), an essential response regulator in Synechococccous elongatus PCC 7942, allows for inducible arrest of cell growth and is associated with a {$>$} 2-fold higher specific productivity of a heterologous sucrose secretion pathway. Finally, we show that sucrose export can partially relieve photosynthetic feedback inhibition imposed by the RpaB dependent growth arrest, allowing sucrose-secreting strains to maintain higher photosynthetic efficiencies. This work provides a novel conceptual framework for improving photosynthetic productivity and cyanobacterial bioproduction.},

Under these same conditions, the equation that describes the effect of temperature and ionic strength on the decomposition of OCl(-) is the following: log k(2) = 0.149\&mgr; + log[2.083 x 10(10)T exp(-1.018 x 10(5)/RT) exp(-56.5/R)] where k(2) has units of M(-)(1) sec(-)(1) and \&mgr; is between 1 and 6 molar. Numerical simulation of the decomposition of OCl(-) was carried out while taking into account the effect of each of the above experimental variables.

We reviewed technologies for carrying out bioremediation and observed that biotechnological approaches that are designed to carry out remediation have received a great deal of attention in recent years. Biostimulation (meaning the addition of limiting nutrients to support microbial growth) and Bioaugmentation (meaning the addition of living cells capable of degradation) studies have enjoyed a heavy presence in literature and reviews of these technologies focusing on the technical aspects are very few if at all available. At times, nutrient application alone or augmenting with microbes is not sufficient enough for remediation leading to a simultaneous approach. Recent studies show that a combination of both approaches is equally feasible but not explicitly more beneficial. Evidently, selection of a technology hinges on site specific requirements such as availability of microorganisms capable of degradation in sufficient quantities, nutrient availability to support microbial growth and proliferation as well as environmental parameters such as temperature in combination with duration of exposure. This review focuses on these technologies and efforts are directed towards eventual manipulation of the processes of remediation all geared towards making bioremediation technically and economically viable for comprehensive treatment of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soils.},

  abstract = {The formation of FtsZ rings (Z rings) in various fts mutants was examined by immunoelectron microscopy and immunofluorescence. In two temperature-sensitive ftsZ mutants which form filaments with smooth morphology , the Z ring was unable to form. In ftsA, ftsI, and ftsQ mutants, which form filaments with an indented morphology, Z rings formed but their contraction was blocked. These results indicate that fully functional ftsA, ftsQ, and ftsI genes are not required for Z-ring formation and are unlikely to have a role in localization of the Z ring. The results also suggest that one function of the Z ring is to localize the activity of other fts gene products. It has been demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy that FtsZ undergoes dynamic localization during the cell division cycle in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis (2, 29). In these organisms, FtsZ migrates from the cytoplasm to mid-cell, where it is localized in a ring pattern designated the FtsZ ring (Z ring). It appears that once the Z ring is formed, sep-tation ensues, with the Z ring maintaining a position at the leading tip of the invaginating septum. Upon completion of the septum, FtsZ disassembles and is not associated with the nas-cent cell pole. It has been hypothesized that the Z ring functions as a cytoskeletal element that mediates invagination of the septum (20). In vitro evidence demonstrating that FtsZ is a GTPase (12, 22, 25, 29) and can under go GTP-dependent assembly into filaments is also consistent with this hypothesis (7, 14, 23). Also consistent with this hypothesis is our finding that Z rings with abnormal geometries are formed in an ftsZ26(Ts) mutant (3). Such abnormal Z rings are associated with abnormal septal morphologies, suggesting that the pattern of septal ingrowth is dictated by the shape of the Z ring. In addition to ftsZ, a number of additional genes have been identified that are required for cell division. Among the best characterized are ftsA, ftsQ, and ftsI. ftsI encodes PBP3, which is specifically required for septal peptidoglycan biosynthesis (6, 26). Presumably, this enzyme is locally activated during septa-tion. ftsA encodes a protein that has homology to the DnaK-actin family of ATPases (5). Little is known about the function of FtsQ (8). The order in which the various genes function during cell division is suggested by the morphology of the filaments produced as a result of loss of the gene function (27). A temperature sensitive mutation in ftsZ produces filaments with a smooth morphology, whereas mutations in ftsA and ftsI produce filaments with indented morphology. These indentations are thought to arise from abortive septation events, indicating that ftsA and ftsI act after ftsZ. This order of action of these genes agrees with the order that has been inferred from the terminal phenotype observed after combining a temperature-sensitive division mutation with a mutation in the peptidogly-can elongation system which causes E. coli to grow as spheres (1). The addition of such a spherical mutation amplifies the effect of septation on morphology. Thus, combination of ftsZ84 with a rodA mutation results in lemon-shaped cells with no sign of initiation of septation at the nonpermissive temperature. In contrast, combination of a rodA mutation with a ftsA, ftsI, or ftsQ mutation results in filaments that appear to have partial constrictions, indicating that septation initiated but was then aborted. From the above analysis of the order of gene action, one would predict that the Z ring can form in ftsA, ftsI, and ftsQ mutants and initiates septation. However, progression is blocked and the Z rings may or may not be stable. In ftsZ mutants, the Z ring either does not form or, if it does, does not function. To test these expectations, we examined Z-ring formation in these mutants by using immunoelectron microscopy and immunofluorescence. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains. The strains used in this study are all derivatives of E. coli K-12 strain MC4100 (2, 9). They included MC4100T (leu::Tn10), MCZ84 [leu:: Tn10 ftsZ84 (Ts)], MCZ26 [leu::Tn10 ftsA27 (Ts)], MCA6 [leu::Tn10 ftsA6 (Ts)], MCA12 [leu::Tn10 ftsA12 (Ts)], MCA27 [leu::Tn10 ftsZ84 (Ts)], MCQ1 [leu:: Tn10 ftsQ1 (Ts)], and MCI23 [leu::Tn10 ftsI23 (Ts)] and were described previously (3, 11). All strains were grown in L broth as previously described (2, 11). Immunoelectron microscopy. The procedure used for immunoelectron mi-croscopy was essentially that described previously (2). Exponentially growing cells were fixed in the growth medium by addition of 2\% glutaraldehyde for 30 to 45 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed once with PBS (10 mM Na 3 PO 4 [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM KCl) and then immersed in 30\% ethanol for 20 min. Cells were stained for 17 min in 2\% uranyl acetate dissolved in 50\% ethanol. The cells were subsequently dehydrated by incubation for 5 min each in a series of ethanol solutions with increasing concentrations of 70, 80, 90, and 100\%. Incubation in 100\% ethanol was repeated once for 10 min. Cells were infiltrated with LR White resin (London Resin Co.) overnight at 4C and embedded by addition of fresh resin and incubation overnight at 60C. Thin sections were cut with an LKB-Ultratome (NOVA) and placed on nickel grids for immunostaining. The grids were rinsed in 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 5 min, blocked in 50 mM Tris-HCl-0.15 M NaCl-1\% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (TSB buffer) for 15 min, and stained with an affinity-purified FtsZ antibody solution (in TSB buffer) for 1 to 2 h at room temperature. The grids were washed twice with TSB buffer and incubated with 10-nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Amersham; diluted 1:10 in TSB buffer) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The grids were again washed twice with TSB buffer and then twice with distilled water. Cells were stained for 2 min with aqueous 7\% uranyl acetate and dried before examination with an electron microscope (JEOL 100-CXII). Immunofluorescent staining. Cells were fixed and stained by minor adjustments to a protocol provided by Kit Pogliano (16). Derivatives of strain MC4100 growing at 30 or 42C were fixed directly in growth medium by addition of paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and Na 3 PO 4 buffer (pH 7.4) to final concentrations of 2.6\% (vol/vol), 0.04\% (vol/vol), and 32.25 mM, respectively. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and for a further 50 min on ice. Fixed cells were washed three times in PBS at room temperature by},

  abstract = {Fibrous structures with nanoscale diameters offer a multitude of fascinating features, such as excellent mechanical behavior and large surface area to volume ratio, making them attractive for many applications. Their large surface area also gives them high functionalization ability. Among the many techniques available for generating nanofibers, electrospinning is rapidly emerging as a simple process in which careful control of operating conditions and polymer solution properties enables the production of highly porous structures of smooth non-woven nanofibers. Compared to traditional phase inversion techniques for membrane fabrication, electrospinning allows the formation of interconnected pores with uniform pore size and porosities exceeding 90\%. As a result, electrospun membranes are increasingly being applied to many water purification applications such as membrane distillation and pretreatment of feed prior to reverse osmosis or nanofiltration processes by the removal of divalent metal ions, grease and other contaminants. Although the use of electrospinning for membrane fabrication has previously been reviewed, the rapid increase in developments over recent years has necessitated the need for a review on the preparation and application of electrospun nanofiber membranes as the barrier layer for water treatment, with emphasis on the reinforcement and post-treatment of electrospun polymer membranes.},

  abstract = {Bioregeneration is defined as the renewal of the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon by microorganisms for further adsorption. Bioregeneration of activated carbon increases the service-life of activated carbons. It is traditionally believed that bioregeneration occurs as a result of a concentration gradient between the carbon and the bulk liquid. Therefore, bioregeneration can only occur for compounds that readily desorb. Some researchers suggest that also exo-enzymes act in bioregeneration. Bioregeneration has been demontrated in offline systems, which involve desorption and biological removal of adsorbed organic matter in a closed-loop recirculating batch system. It has also been shown that bioregeneration of carbon occurs during the time course of wastewater treatment processes that are based on biological activated carbons (BACs). However, most of the studies aiming at quantifying bioregeneration were performed using offline systems because of difficulties encountered in quantifying bioregeneration during BAC treatments of wastewater. Bioregeneration is dependent on several factors including biodegradability, adsorbability and desorbability of sorbate, characteristics of activated carbon and process configuration, and it can be optimized by varying the operational conditions. In this review, we are addressing the enhancement of biological treatment by activated carbon, the definition and mechanisms of biological regeneration, the relationship between adsorption reversibility and bioregeneration, the factors affecting bioregeneration, the methods for determination and quantification of bioregeneration and the mathematical models of bioregeneration. Future research is still required to determine the optimum conditions for an increased bioregeneration. Particularly, factors such as the activated carbon type, nature of the microbial community and optimum process configuration need further investigation. The validity and efficiency of exo-enzymatic activities on bioregeneration should still be investigated. ?? 2007.},

Here we show that the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus Ribonuclease (RNase) E assembles RNP LLPS condensates that we term bacterial RNP-bodies (BR-bodies), similar to eukaryotic P-bodies and stress granules. RNase E requires RNA to assemble a BR-body, and disassembly requires RNA cleavage, suggesting BR-bodies provide localized sites of RNA degradation. The unstructured C-terminal domain of RNase E is both necessary and sufficient to assemble the core of the BR-body, is functionally conserved in related α-proteobacteria, and influences mRNA degradation. BR-bodies are rapidly induced under cellular stresses and provide enhanced cell growth under stress. To our knowledge, Caulobacter RNase E is the first bacterial protein identified that forms LLPS condensates, providing an effective strategy for subcellular organization in cells lacking membrane-bound compartments. Al-Husini et al. show that the Caulobacter RNA degradosome assembles a liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) biomolecular condensate “BR-body.” Caulobacter RNase E is the first protein of bacterial origin found to form perform LLPS, providing a useful mechanism for bacteria to organize their biochemical pathways in the absence of membrane-bound organelles.},

Therefore, the control of growth of gram-negative bacteria offers a way to diminish biodeterioration of stone materials. The effect of potential permeabilizers on the outer membrane (OM) properties of gram-negative bacteria was investigated and further characterized. In addition, efficacy of the agents in enhancing the activity of a biocide (benzalkonium chloride) was assessed. EDTA, polyethylenimine (PEI), and succimer (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic) were shown to be efficient permeabilizers of the members of Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas genera, as indicated by an increase in the uptake of a hydrophobic probe (1-N-phenylnaphthylamine) and sensitization to hydrophobic antibiotics. Visualization of Pseudomonas cells treated with EDTA or PEI by atomic force microscopy revealed damage in the outer membrane structure. PEI especially increased the surface area and bulges of the cells. Topographic images of EDTA-treated cells were compatible with events assigned for the effect of EDTA on outer membranes, i.e., release of lipopolysaccharide and disintegration of OM structure. In addition, the effect of EDTA treatment was visualized in phase-contrast images as large areas with varying hydrophilicity on cell surfaces. In liquid culture tests, EDTA and PEI supplementation enhanced the activity of benzalkonium chloride toward the target strains. Use of permeabilizers in biocide formulations would enable the use of decreased concentrations of the active biocide ingredient, thereby providing environmentally friendlier products.},

To allow this association, numerous symbiotic-dependent adaptations in both partners, resulting from evolutionary pressures, have been selected. The dinoflagellate symbionts (zooxanthellae) are located inside a vesicle in the cnidarian host cell and are therefore exposed to a very different environment compared to the free-living state of these microalgae in terms of ion concentration and carbon content and speciation. In addition, this intracellular localization imposes that they rely completely upon the host for their nutrient supply (nitrogen, CO2). Symbiotic-dependent adaptations imposed to the animal host by phototrophic symbiosis are more relevant to photosynthetic organisms than to metazoans: indeed, the cnidarian host often harbours diurnal changes of morphology to adapt itself to the amount of light and possesses carbon-concentrating mechanisms, antioxidative defences and UV sunscreens similar to that present in phototrophs. These adaptations and the contrasting fragility of the association are discussed from both ecological and evolutionary points of view.},

  abstract = {The emergence of cooperation is a central question in evolutionary biology. Microorganisms often cooperate by producing a chemical resource (a public good) that benefits other cells. The sharing of public goods depends on their diffusion through space. Previous theory suggests that spatial structure can promote evolution of cooperation, but the diffusion of public goods introduces new phenomena that must be modeled explicitly. We develop an approach where colony geometry and public good diffusion are described by graphs. We find that the success of cooperation depends on a simple relation between the benefits and costs of the public good, the amount retained by a producer, and the average amount retained by each of the producer’s neighbors. These quantities are derived as analytic functions of the graph topology and diffusion rate. In general, cooperation is favored for small diffusion rates, low colony dimensionality, and small rates of decay of the public good.The natural world is often thought of as a cruel place, with most living things ruthlessly competing for space or resources as they struggle to survive. However, from two chimps picking the fleas off each other to thousands of worker ants toiling for the good of the colony, cooperation is fairly widespread in nature. Surprisingly, even single-celled microbes cooperate.Individual bacterial and yeast cells often produce molecules that are used by others. Whilst many cells share the benefits of these ‘public goods’, at least some cells have to endure the costs involved in producing them. As such, selfish individuals can benefit from molecules made by others, without making their own. However, if everyone cheated in this way, the public good would be lost completely: this is called the ‘public goods dilemma’.Allen et al. have developed a mathematical model of a public goods dilemma within a microbial colony, in which the public good travels from its producers to other cells by diffusion. The fate of cooperation in this ‘diffusible public goods dilemma’ depends on the spatial arrangement of cells, which in turn depends on their shape and the spacing between them. Other important factors include rates of diffusion and decay of the public good—both of which affect how widely the public good is shared.The model predicts that cooperation is favored when the diffusion rate is small, when the colonies are flatter, and when the public goods decay slowly. These conditions maximize the benefit of the public goods enjoyed by the cell producing them and its close neighbors, which are also likely to be producers. Public goods dilemmas are common in nature and society, so there is much interest in identifying general principles that promote cooperation.},

  abstract = {An innovative type of biofilm model is derived by combining an individual description of microbial particles with a continuum representation of the biofilm matrix. This hybrid model retains the advantages of each approach, while providing a more realistic description of the temporal development of biofilm structure in two or three spatial dimensions. The general model derivation takes into account any possible number of soluble components. These are substrates and metabolic products, which diffuse and react in the biofilm within individual microbial cells. The cells grow, divide, and produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in a multispecies model setting. The EPS matrix is described by a continuum representation as incompressible viscous fluid, which can expand and retract due to generation and consumption processes. The cells move due to a pushing mechanism between cells in colonies and by an advective mechanism supported by the EPS dynamics. Detachment of both cells and EPS follows a continuum approach, whereas cells attach in discrete events. Two case studies are presented for model illustration. Biofilm consolidation is explained by shrinking due to EPS and cell degradation processes. This mechanism describes formation of a denser layer of cells in the biofilm depth and occurrence of an irregularly shaped biofilm surface under nutrient limiting conditions. Micro-colony formation is investigated by growth of autotrophic microbial colonies in an EPS matrix produced by heterotrophic cells. Size and shape of colonies of ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are comparatively studied in a standard biofilm and in biofilms aerated from a membrane side. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A strong linearity is observed between the nitrogen-nitrogen bond length and the absorption wavelength with a squared correlation coefficient of 0.90. Bond lengths and properties of the critical points located on the electron density distribution are used to build partial least squares regression models for quantitative prediction of absorption wavelengths. Fifty of the azobenzene dyes were used as an external test set to evaluate the overall performance of the models. The simplest model where only the nitrogen-nitrogen bond length is used as a descriptor gives a root mean square error of prediction of 12.6 nm. When the value, laplacian and ellipticity of the electron density in all comparable bond critical points are used, the error of prediction is reduced to 5.4 nm. However, this model is less general and robust to prediction of novel molecular structures. It is demonstrated that the nitrogen-nitrogen bond in the azobenzene compounds relates to the colour of the dyes and in particular the nitrogen-nitrogen bond length plays a central role.},

However, long-term viability and metabolic activity of entrapped bacteria is affected by several conditions such as their physiological state, the presence of high-osmolarity environments, porous structure and shrinkage of the matrix. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of various parameters on bacteria immobilized in sol-gel-derived silica matrices. With this purpose, we evaluated the stress of immobilization over bacteria cultures obtained from different growing states, the effect of cell density and bacteria capability to proliferate inside matrices. Best results to attain longer preservation times were obtained when we immobilized suspensions with an optimized bacterial number of 1 x 10(7) cfu/gel in the presence of LB medium using aqueous silica precursors. Furthermore, the impact of osmotic stress with the subsequent intracellular trehalose accumulation and the addition of osmolites were investigated. Shorter preservation times were found for bacteria immobilized in the presence of osmolites while trehalose accumulation in stressed cells did not produce changes on entrapped bacteria viability. Finally, nutrient addition in silica matrices was studied indicating that the presence of a carbon source without the simultaneous addition of nitrogen was detrimental for immobilized E. coli. However, when both carbon and nitrogen sources were present, bacteria were able to survive longer periods of time.},

  abstract = {Thermal and ozone regenerations of granular activated carbons (GAC) used in the removal of phenol from aqueous solution have been studied. The phenol isotherms for virgin GAC could be well represented by the Langmuir equation. Direct ozonation of GAC introduced large amounts of acidic surface oxygen groups, which caused a decrease in the phenol uptake. Thermogravimetric methods were used to investigate the mechanism of phenol adsorption onto virgin and ozonated carbons. Thermal regeneration was carried out at 1123K using nitrogen (pyrolysis alone) or nitrogen and carbon dioxide (pyrolysis plus oxidation). Results showed that spent carbons do not recover their adsorption characteristics when heated under inert conditions whereas carbon dioxide regeneration was effective at about 15\% wt burn-off. Regeneration of GAC was also carried out with ozone as oxidizing gas at room temperature. Ozone dose and the nature of GAC have much influence on the regeneration performance. For an individual GAC there exits an optimum ozone dose for which phenol is eliminated together with most of its oxidation by-products without incurring in carbon surface chemical alterations. However, if excessive ozone is applied some acidic surface groups are formed on the GAC, thereby decreasing the adsorption capacity for phenol. Results showed that spent carbons can recover most of their adsorption characteristics and specific surface areas when regenerated through a number of adsorption-ozone regeneration cycles. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, synthetic cooperation is a promising lead towards the engineering of novel functions and enhanced productivity of microbial communities. Here, we review recent progress on engineered cooperation in microbial ecosystems.

  abstract = {thereby providing survival benefits against the chemical challenges in the GI tract. Unfortunately, this also prevents probiotics from directly contacting intestinal surfaces, thus diminishing their adhesion and growth to sites of interest. [3c] Overwhelmingly, encapsulation approaches have not trans-lated to survival advantages in animal models or in humans. [3a] This is a trend that extends to the probiotic industry; despite the abundance of probiotic products on the market, few of these have proven to provide health benefits in humans or animals, [2b,19] thus highlighting the need for advanced probiotic delivery systems. Here, we describe a novel probiotic encapsu-lation technology that improves probiotic in vivo delivery by directly addressing: (i) chemical, (ii) physical, and (iii) probiotic-specific encapsulation challenges. Specifically, a layer-by-layer approach [20] leveraging encapsulation of live-probiotics using minimal quantities of polymers is used to protect encapsu-lated probiotics from GI tract insults while providing a means to directly adhere, grow, and proliferate on intestinal surfaces without requiring release from the encapsulating matrix. These advantages translated to enhanced survival and persistence of probiotics in the small intestine in vivo. To our knowledge, the LbL encapsulation strategy described here represents one of the first broad approaches to introduce a probiotic species while simultaneously addressing the chemical, physical, and probiotic-specific encapsulation challenges. The probiotic strain Bacillus coagulans (BC) [21] was success-fully encapsulated using two biodegradable polysaccharides, chitosan and alginate via a LbL approach (Figure 1a). BC is a lactic acid producing probiotic [22] that has exhibited poten-tial therapeutic benefits for treating colitis [23] and abdominal pain and bloating associated with irritable bowel syndrome. [21] Chitosan and alginate are widely used in oral delivery appli-cations as they are both biocompatible and each has unique mucoadhesive properties. [24] Briefly, alternating layers of the cationic polysaccharide chitosan (CHI) and the anionic poly-saccharide alginate (ALG) were sequentially layered on BC via electrostatic interactions for up to three bilayers (CHI/ALG) 3 . LbL facilitates an encapsulation method where the minimum amount of polymer can be used for complete encapsulation/ coating. Bright field imaging of plain-BC (Figure 1b(i) and (CHI/ALG) 2 -BC (Figure 1b(ii) revealed that LbL templating can lead to probiotic aggregation. This occurred after adding the terminal alginate layer, independent of solution pH, and was likely due to assembly of alginate in NaCl solution. [25] Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of plain-BC (Figure 1b(iii) and (CHI/ALG) 2 -BC (Figure 1b(iv) showed that LbL encapsu-lation did not dramatically alter BC surface morphology, likely due to the presence of polysaccharides and sugars already pre-sent in the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. [26] Zeta potential measurements (Figure 1c) confirmed the successful layering of Recent discoveries in biology and microbiology have high-lighted the importance of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome in regulating human health and disease. [1] Thus, the delivery of probiotics to influence and modulate microbiome compositions can potentially impact the treatment of a number of human diseases. [2] Unfortunately, biological challenges encountered during oral delivery have limited the translation of many pro-biotic-delivering technologies. [3] Here, we report a layer-by-layer (LbL) method for the encapsulation of probiotics to directly address these challenges by protecting probiotics from GI tract insults while facilitating both mucoadhesion and direct growth on intestinal surfaces. It has been established that the bacterial composition in the GI tract plays an essential role in the development and progression of a number of disorders, including cancer, [1a] obesity, [4] diabetes, [5] Clostridium difficile, [6] and depression,},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli is a model prokaryote, an important pathogen, and a key organism for industrial biotechnology. E. coli W (ATCC 9637), one of four strains designated as safe for laboratory purposes, has not been sequenced. E. coli W is a fast-growing strain and is the only safe strain that can utilize sucrose as a carbon source. Lifecycle analysis has demonstrated that sucrose from sugarcane is a preferred carbon source for industrial bioprocesses.Results: We have sequenced and annotated the genome of E. coli W. The chromosome is 4,900,968 bp and encodes 4,764 ORFs. Two plasmids, pRK1 (102,536 bp) and pRK2 (5,360 bp), are also present. W has unique features relative to other sequenced laboratory strains (K-12, B and Crooks): it has a larger genome and belongs to phylogroup B1 rather than A. W also grows on a much broader range of carbon sources than does K-12. A genome-scale reconstruction was developed and validated in order to interrogate metabolic properties.Conclusions: The genome of W is more similar to commensal and pathogenic B1 strains than phylogroup A strains, and therefore has greater utility for comparative analyses with these strains. W should therefore be the strain of choice, or 'type strain' for group B1 comparative analyses. The genome annotation and tools created here are expected to allow further utilization and development of E. coli W as an industrial organism for sucrose-based bioprocesses. Refinements in our E. coli metabolic reconstruction allow it to more accurately define E. coli metabolism relative to previous models. © 2011 Archer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

However, sucrose metabolism in Escherichia coli is not well understood because the two most common strains, E. coli K-12 and B, do not grow on sucrose. Here, using a sucrose utilizing strain, E. coli W, we undertake an in-depth comparison of sucrose and glucose metabolism including growth kinetics, metabolite profiling, microarray-based transcriptome analysis, labelling-based proteomic analysis and \textsuperscript{13}C-fluxomics. While E. coli W grew comparably well on sucrose and glucose integration of the omics, datasets showed that during growth on each carbon source, metabolism was distinct. The metabolism was generally derepressed on sucrose, and significant flux rearrangements were observed in central carbon metabolism. These included a reduction in the flux of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway branch, an increase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux and a reduction in the glyoxylate shunt flux due to the dephosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase. But unlike growth on other sugars that induce cAMP-dependent Crp regulation, the phosphoenol-pyruvate-glyoxylate cycle was not active on sucrose. Lower acetate accumulation was also observed in sucrose compared to glucose cultures. This was linked to induction of the acetate catabolic genes actP and acs and independent of the glyoxylic shunt. Overall, the cells stayed highly oxidative. In summary, sucrose metabolism was fast, efficient and led to low acetate accumulation making it an ideal carbon source for industrial fermentation with E. coli W.},

  abstract = {A review. The layer-by-layer (LbL) adsorption technique offers an easy and inexpensive process for multilayer formation and allows a variety of materials to be incorporated within the film structures. Therefore, the LbL assembly method can be regarded as a versatile bottom-up nanofabrication technique. Research fields concerned with LbL assembly have developed rapidly but some important physicochem. aspects remain uninvestigated. In this review, we will introduce several examples from physicochem. investigations regarding the basics of this method to advanced research aimed at practical applications. These are selected mostly from recent reports and should stimulate many phys. chemists and chem. physicists in the further development of LbL assembly. In order to further understand the mechanism of the LbL assembly process, theor. work, including thermodn. calcns., has been conducted. Addnl., the use of mol. dynamics simulation has been proposed. Recently, many kinds of physicochem. mol. interactions, including hydrogen bonding, charge transfer interactions, and stereo-complex formation, have been used. The combination of the LbL method with other fabrication techniques such as spin-coating, spraying, and photolithog. has also been extensively researched. These improvements have enabled prepn. of LbL films composed of various materials contained in well-designed nanostructures. The resulting structures can be used to investigate basic physicochem. phenomena where relative distances between interacting groups is of great importance. Similarly, LbL structures prepd. by such advanced techniques are used widely for development of functional systems for phys. applications from photovoltaic devices and field effect transistors to biochem. applications including nano-sized reactors and drug delivery systems.

Rather, dimension-reduced approaches such as layering of two-dimensional nanostructures into precisely controlled lamellar nanomaterials are currently achievable. In particular, layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is known as a highly versatile method for fabrication of controlled layered structures from various kinds of component materialsusing very simple, inexpensive, and rapid procedures. Therefore, fabrication of multilayer films through the LbL deposition process has attracted growing interest from various research communities.

The appropriateevaluation of this analytical method requires recognizing the different steps involved andto be conscious of their importance and limitations. The first step involved in a QCMsystem is the accurate and appropriate characterization of the sensor in relation to thespecific application. The use of the piezoelectric sensor in contact with solutions stronglyaffects its behavior and appropriate electronic interfaces must be used for an adequatesensor characterization. Systems based on different principles and techniques have beenimplemented during the last 25 years. The interface selection for the specific application isimportant and its limitations must be known to be conscious of its suitability, and foravoiding the possible error propagation in the interpretation of results. This article presentsa comprehensive overview of the different techniques used for AT-cut quartz crystalmicrobalance in in-solution applications, which are based on the following principles:network or impedance analyzers, decay methods, oscillators and lock-in techniques. Theelectronic interfaces based on oscillators and phase-locked techniques are treated in detail,with the description of different configurations, since these techniques are the most used inapplications for detection of analytes in solutions, and in those where a fast sensorresponse is necessary.},

In this review, these topics are considered from biochemical, microbial/molecular biological, and geochemical perspectives. Our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of heterotrophic microbial communities has been greatly advanced in recent years, in part through genetic and genomic approaches. New methods to measure enzyme activities in the field are needed to keep pace with these advances and to pursue intriguing evidence that patterns of enzyme activities in different environments are linked to differences in microbial community composition that may profoundly affect the marine carbon cycle.},

Bacteriol. 92:380-387. 1966. -Incubation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with ethylenediaminetetraacetate induced the formation of osmotically fragile rods termed osmoplasts. These could be restored to osmotically stable forms by multivalent cations. Only those cells restored by divalent cations normally found in the cell wall were capable of multiplication. The respiration of restored cells, however, was unimpaired, irrespective of whether they were capable of multiplication. Moreover, the permeability characteristics of osmoplasts and restored cells were unimpaired. When multivalent cations were chelated from the cell wall and replaced by sodium, a weakened cell wall and an osmotically fragile cell resulted. This was apparently caused by the absence of cross-linkages in the cell wall via multivalent cations. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer compounded the lethal effects of ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The lipopolysaccharide component was inferred to be the site of attack by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. A mechanism for the synthesis of the lipopolysaccharide sacculus was proposed whereby negatively charged subunits are "trapped" by forming ionic and coordinate bonds intermediated by multivalent cations.},

The fungus provides a suitable habitat for the partner, which provides photosynthetically fixed carbon as energy source for the system. The evolutionary result of the self-sustaining partnership is a unique joint structure, the lichen thallus, which is indispensable for fungal sexual reproduction. The classical view of a dual symbiosis has been challenged by recent microbiome research, which revealed host-specific bacterial microbiomes. The recent results about bacterial associations with lichens symbioses corroborate their notion as a multi-species symbiosis. Multi-omics approaches have provided evidence for functional contribution by the bacterial microbiome to the entire lichen meta-organism while various abiotic and biotic factors can additionally influence the bacterial community structure. Results of current research also suggest that neighboring ecological niches influence the composition of the lichen bacterial microbiome. Specificity and functions are here reviewed based on these recent findings, converging to a holistic view of bacterial roles in lichens. Finally we propose that the lichen thallus has also evolved to function as a smart harvester of bacterial symbionts. We suggest that lichens represent an ideal model to study multi-species symbiosis, using the recently available omics tools and other cutting edge methods.},

  abstract = {Biodegradation of the gasoline oxygenates methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE) can cause tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) to accumulate in gasoline-impacted environments. One remediation option for TBA-contaminated groundwater involves oxygenated granulated activated carbon (GAC) reactors that have been self-inoculated by indigenous TBA-degrading microorganisms in ground water extracted from contaminated aquifers. Identification of these organisms is important for understanding the range of TBA-metabolizing organisms in nature and for determining whether self-inoculation of similar reactors is likely to occur at other sites. In this study (13)C-DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) was used to identify TBA-utilizing organisms in samples of self-inoculated BioGAC reactors operated at sites in New York and California. Based on 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences, all TBA-utilizing organisms identified were members of the Burkholderiales order of the β-proteobacteria. Organisms similar to Cupriavidus and Methylibium were observed in both reactor samples while organisms similar to Polaromonas and Rhodoferax were unique to the reactor sample from New York. Organisms similar to Hydrogenophaga and Paucibacter strains were only detected in the reactor sample from California. We also analyzed our samples for the presence of several genes previously implicated in TBA oxidation by pure cultures of bacteria. Genes Mpe\_B0532, B0541, B0555, and B0561 were all detected in (13)C-metagenomic DNA from both reactors and deduced amino acid sequences suggested these genes all encode highly conserved enzymes. One gene (Mpe\_B0555) encodes a putative phthalate dioxygenase-like enzyme that may be particularly appropriate for determining the potential for TBA oxidation in contaminated environmental samples.},

Different parts of these metabolic networks are defined as subsystems/pathways, which are sets of functional roles to implement a specific biological process or structural complex, such as glycolysis and TCA cycle. Subsystem/pathway definition is also employed to delineate the biosynthetic routes that produce biomass building blocks. In databases, such as MetaCyc and SEED, these representations are composed of linear routes from precursors to target biomass building blocks. However, this approach cannot capture the nested, complex nature of GEMs. Here we implemented an algorithm, lumpGEM, which generates biosynthetic subnetworks composed of reactions that can synthesize a target metabolite from a set of defined core precursor metabolites. lumpGEM captures balanced subnetworks, which account for the fate of all metabolites along the synthesis routes, thus encapsulating reactions from various subsystems/pathways to balance these metabolites in the metabolic network. Moreover, lumpGEM collapses these subnetworks into elementally balanced lumped reactions that specify the cost of all precursor metabolites and cofactors. It also generates alternative subnetworks and lumped reactions for the same metabolite, accounting for the flexibility of organisms. lumpGEM is applicable to any GEM and any target metabolite defined in the network. Lumped reactions generated by lumpGEM can be also used to generate properly balanced reduced core metabolic models.},

However the complexity of these large metabolic networks often hinders their utility in various practical applications. Although reduced models are commonly used for modeling and in integrating experimental data, they are often inconsistent across different studies and laboratories due to different criteria and detail, which can compromise transferability of the findings and also integration of experimental data from different groups. In this study, we have developed a systematic semi-automatic approach to reduce genome-scale models into core models in a consistent and logical manner focusing on the central metabolism or subsystems of interest. The method minimizes the loss of information using an approach that combines graph-based search and optimization methods. The resulting core models are shown to be able to capture key properties of the genome-scale models and preserve consistency in terms of biomass and by-product yields, flux and concentration variability and gene essentiality.

The direct biological oxygenation of spiro ring compounds was demonstrated here for the first time. These and other hydrocarbon ring compounds have previously been shown to be present in flowback and produced waters from hydraulic fracturing operations. Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 9816-4 containing naphthalene dioxygenase was selected for its broad substrate specificity and it was demonstrated here to oxidize fundamental ring structures that are common in shale-derived waters but not previously investigated with this or related enzymes. Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4 was tested here in the presence of a silica encasement, a protocol that has been shown previously to protect bacteria against the extremes of salinity present in fracking waste waters. These studies demonstrate degradation of highly hydrophobic compounds by a silica-encapsulated model bacterium, demonstrate what it may not degrade, and contribute to a knowledge of the full range of hydrocarbon ring compounds that can be oxidized using Pseudomonas sp.

  abstract = {This review is devoted to the most recent developments (2000-2005) of sol-gel materials at the interface with biology. In the context of bioencapsulation in mineral hosts, novel synthetic approaches have been designed, allowing the immobilization of numerous proteins, enzymes and immune molecules as well as poly-saccharides, phospholipids and nucleic acids. These efforts have led to the development of new biosensors and bioreactors. A similar trend was also observed for whole cell encapsulation, survival periods over several weeks now being achieved. This has opened the possibility of designing hybrid hosts for cell-based biosensing and bioproduction, ultimately allowing the development of artificial organs. Indeed, applications of sol-gel processes are not restricted to bioencapsulation, as demonstrated by recent progress in drug release systems and bioactive materials. Finally, the considerable efforts devoted to the biomimetic elaboration of mineral structures suggest that they might be the key for future development of improved sol-gel materials for bio-applications.},

A small spot on the fluorescent surface is photobleached by a brief exposure to an intense focused laser beam, and the subsequent recovery of the fluorescence is monitored by the same, but attenuated, laser beam. Recovery occurs by replenishment of intact fluorophore in the bleached spot by lateral transport from the surrounding surface. The authors present the theoretical basis and some practical guidelines for simple, rigorous analysis of FPR experiments. Information obtainable from FPR experiments includes identification of transport process type, i.e. the admixture of random diffusion and uniform directed flow; determination of the absolute mobility coefficient, i.e. the diffusion constant and/or flow velocity; and the fraction of total fluorophore which is mobile. To illustrate the experimental method and to verify the theory for diffusion, the authors describe some model experiments on aqueous solutions of rhodamine 6G.},

Multicellular building blocks (bioinks) are dispensed layer by layer and scaled for the target construct. However, only a few materials are able to fulfill the considerable requirements for suitable bioink formulation, a critical component of efficient 3D bioprinting. Alginate, a naturally occurring polysaccharide, is clearly the most commonly employed material in current bioinks. Here, we discuss the benefits and disadvantages of the use of alginate in 3D bioprinting by summarizing the most recent studies that used alginate for printing vascular tissue, bone and cartilage. In addition, other breakthroughs in the use of alginate in bioprinting are discussed, including strategies to improve its structural and degradation characteristics. In this review, we organize the available literature in order to inspire and accelerate novel alginate-based bioink formulations with enhanced properties for future applications in basic research, drug screening and regenerative medicine.},

It has been shown that at high initial concentration of solute (sorbate) the general equation converts to a pseudo-first-order model and at lower initial concentration of solute it converts to a pseudo-second-order model. In other words, the sorption process obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics at high initial concentration of solute, while it obeys pseudo-second-order kinetics model at lower initial concentration of solute. The theoretical results (derived equations) show that the observed rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are combinations of adsorption and desorption rate constants and also initial concentration of solute. The obtained theoretical equations are used to correlate experimental data for sorption kinetics of some solutes on various sorbents. The predictions of the theory are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The deposition process involved the alternate layer by layer electrostatic (Coulombic) interaction between oppositely charged adsorbing polyelectrolytes resulting in ultrathin multilayer films. Three kinds of polyelectrolyte combinations were used: poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) as the cationic polymers and poly(sodium-4-styrensulfonate) (PSS) as the anionic polymer for polycation/polyanion combinations. The electrical behavior of the piezoelectric 'quartz crystal' was sensitive to the adsorption properties of the polyelectrolytes, thus allowing close observation of the time-dependent adsorption processes. The adsorption relationship was explored for different polyelectrolyte pair-combinations, alternate solution concentration and the presence of rinsing and drying steps. The results showed that the amount of frequency change is mostly dependent on the immediate subphase environment of the crystal surface, i.e. aqueous environment versus air in relation to the classic Sauerbrey equation.

For instance, a proportion of non-dividing bacteria could persist through antibiotic challenges and secure population survival. This heterogeneity can be studied in complex environmental or clinical samples by spreading the bacteria on agar plates and monitoring time to growth resumption in order to infer their metabolic state distribution. We present ColTapp, the Colony Time-lapse application for bacterial colony growth quantification. Its intuitive graphical user interface allows users to analyze time-lapse images of agar plates to monitor size, color and morphology of colonies. Additionally, images at isolated timepoints can be used to estimate lag time. Using ColTapp, we analyze a dataset of Staphylococcus aureus time-lapse images including populations with heterogeneous lag time. Colonies on dense plates reach saturation early, leading to overestimation of lag time from isolated images. We show that this bias can be corrected by taking into account the area available to each colony on the plate. We envision that in clinical settings, improved analysis of colony growth dynamics may help treatment decisions oriented towards personalized antibiotic therapies.},

By monitoring a large library of single transposoninsertion mutants with high-throughput sequencing, these methods can rapidly identify genomic regions that contribute to organismal fitness under any condition assayable in the laboratory with exquisite resolution. We discuss the various protocols that have been developed and methods for analysis. We provide an overview of studies that have examined the reproducibility and accuracy of these methods, as well as studies showing the advantages offered by the high resolution and dynamic range of high-throughput sequencing over previous methods. We review a number of applications in the literature, from predicting genes essential for in vitro growth to directly assaying requirements for survival under infective conditions in vivo. We also highlight recent progress in assaying non-coding regions of the genome in addition to known coding sequences, including the combining of RNAseq with high-throughput transposon mutagenesis. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

Intrinsic mechanisms of catalyst deactivation are many; nevertheless, they can be classified into six distinct types: (i) poisoning, (ii) fouling, (iii) thermal degradation, (iv) vapor compound formation accompanied by transport, (v) vapor-solid and/or solid-solid reactions, and (vi) attrition/crushing. As (i), (iv), and (v) are chemical in nature and (ii) and (v) are mechanical, the causes of deactivation are basically three-fold: chemical, mechanical and thermal. Each of these six mechanisms is defined and its features are illustrated by data and examples from the literature. The status of knowledge and needs for further work are also summarized for each type of deactivation mechanism. The development during the past two decades of more sophisticated surface spectroscopies and powerful computer technologies provides opportunities for obtaining substantially better understanding of deactivation mechanisms and building this understanding into comprehensive mathematical models that will enable more effective design and optimization of processes involving deactivating catalysts. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

In this study, we combine both techniques into the R package BacArena (https://cran.r-project.org/package=BacArena) to generate novel biological insights into Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation as well as a seven species model community of the human gut. For our P. aeruginosa model, we found that cross-feeding of fermentation products cause a spatial differentiation of emerging metabolic phenotypes in the biofilm over time. In the human gut model community, we found that spatial gradients of mucus glycans are important for niche formations which shape the overall community structure. Additionally, we could provide novel hypothesis concerning the metabolic interactions between the microbes. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial and temporal multi-scale modeling approaches such as BacArena.},

One particular group of microorganisms that is fast becoming recognized for their commercial potential is cyanobacteria. Through the process of photosynthesis, cyanobacteria can use CO {$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} as a building block to synthesize carbon-based chemicals. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dependent approaches have rapidly gained popularity for engineering cyanobacteria. Such approaches permit markerless genome editing, simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes, and transcriptional regulation of genes. The drastically shortened timescale for mutant selection and segregation is especially advantageous for cyanobacterial work. In this review, we highlight studies that have implemented CRISPR-based tools for the metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to improve the accuracy of constraint-based metabolic models, several approaches have been developed which intend to integrate additional biological information. Two of these methods, MOMENT and GECKO, incorporate enzymatic (kcat) parameters and enzyme mass constraints to further constrain the space of feasible metabolic flux distributions. While both methods have been proven to deliver useful extensions of metabolic models, they may considerably increase size and complexity of the models and there is currently no tool available to fully automate generation and calibration of such enzyme-constrained models from given stoichiometric models. RESULTS: In this work we present three major developments. We first conceived short MOMENT (sMOMENT), a simplified version of the MOMENT approach, which yields the same predictions as MOMENT but requires significantly fewer variables and enables direct inclusion of the relevant enzyme constraints in the standard representation of a constraint-based model. When measurements of enzyme concentrations are available, these can be included as well leading in the extreme case, where all enzyme concentrations are known, to a model representation that is analogous to the GECKO approach. Second, we developed the AutoPACMEN toolbox which allows an almost fully automated creation of sMOMENT-enhanced stoichiometric metabolic models. In particular, this includes the automatic read-out and processing of relevant enzymatic data from different databases and the reconfiguration of the stoichiometric model with embedded enzymatic constraints. Additionally, tools have been developed to adjust (kcat and enzyme pool) parameters of sMOMENT models based on given flux data. We finally applied the new sMOMENT approach and the AutoPACMEN toolbox to generate an enzyme-constrained version of the E. coli genome-scale model iJO1366 and analyze its key properties and differences with the standard model. In particular, we show that the enzyme constraints improve flux predictions (e.g., explaining overflow metabolism and other metabolic switches) and demonstrate, for the first time, that these constraints can markedly change the spectrum of metabolic engineering strategies for different target products. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological and tool developments presented herein pave the way for a simplified and routine construction and analysis of enzyme-constrained metabolic models.},

  abstract = {In order to understand the role that proteins play in the generation of well regulated biosilica structures we need to understand the contribution of the components, singly and in combination. To this end we have performed a systematic study of the effect of amino acids and small peptide oligomers on silica formation from aqueous solution. Silicas produced from a potassium silicon catecholate salt at ca. pH 7 in the presence of the amino acids (Gly, Arg, Asn, Gln, Glx, Ser, Thr, Tyr, Pro, Ala, Lys) at a 2 Si : 1 amino acid molar ratio have shown that these amino acids affect the kinetics of small oligomer formation, the growth of aggregate structures and the morphology and surface properties of the silicas produced. The effects seen during the early stages of oligomer formation carry through to the properties of the particles and aggregates produced after extended periods of reaction. The behaviour of the amino acids relates to the pI and hydrophobicity of the individual amino acids. The presence of the nitrogen containing amino acids generates larger particles and the presence of amino acids containing hydroxyl and hydrophobic groups generates silicas with smaller particles than are produced for silicas produced in the absence of amino acids. An extensive study of the effect of the number of lysine and glycine units per peptide was also performed (for lysine, 1–5 and ca. 150 and for glycine, 1,4,5). Increasing the number of glycine units per additive molecule had little effect on the kinetics, aggregation, sample morphology, surface area and porosity of the silicas produced. A distinct relationship between the number of lysine units per additive molecule and an increased rate of oligomer formation, aggregate growth and a reduction in silica surface area and broadening of pore sizes was observed. A distinct change over in behaviour, particularly in regard to the porosity characteristics of the silica produced was noted for between (lys) 3 and (lys) 4 as well as this being the smallest size of peptide that was incorporated into the siliceous material formed. Aggregation was observed to accelerate exponentially over the full range of lysine oligomers used. Consecutive sequences of the same amino acid residues were shown to produce effects much larger than the sum of the effects of the individual residues, and at extremes mediate macroscopic morphological changes. The consequences of these findings for biosilicification are discussed. It is clear that all amino acid functional groups in proteins that are accessible to silica during the stages of formation from orthosilicic acid through to the final material have a role to play in determining the physical nature and structure of the material that forms.},

Our common efforts to continuously improve vascular replacement design have provided many clues about our own blood vessels, but nature's ability to create nonthrombogenic, immunocompatible, strong, yet biologically responsive blood vessels remains unparalleled.

  abstract = {The susceptibilities of three Gram-positive cocci to medium-chain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and their one-monoglycerides were studied. The bacteria were incubated with equal volumes of lipid solutions for 10 min. Lauric acid, palmitoleic acid and monocaprin reduced the number of CFU by 6.0 log10 or greater at 5 mM concentration for streptococci of group A (GAS) and group B (GBS). When further compared at lower concentrations and after longer incubation time monocaprin proved to be the most active. Capric acid showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus aureus at 10 mM. However, at lower concentrations monocaprin was the only lipid that showed significant activity against S. aureus. The mode of action of monocaprin against GBS was studied by a novel two-color fluorescent assay of bacterial viability and by electron microscopy. The results indicate that the bacteria are killed by disintegration of the cell membrane by the lipid, leaving the bacterial cell wall intact. The highly lethal effect of monocaprin indicates that this lipid might be useful as a microbicidal agent for prevention and treatment of infections caused by these bacteria.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms, and especially cyanobacteria, hold great promise as sources of renewably-produced fuels, bulk and specialty chemicals, and nutritional products. Synthetic biology tools can help unlock cyanobacteria's potential for these functions, but unfortunately tool development for these organisms has lagged behind that for S. cerevisiae and E. coli. While these organisms may in many cases be more difficult to work with as "chassis" strains for synthetic biology than certain heterotrophs, the unique advantages of autotrophs in biotechnology applications as well as the scientific importance of improved understanding of photosynthesis warrant the development of these systems into something akin to a "green E. coli." In this review, we highlight unique challenges and opportunities for development of synthetic biology approaches in cyanobacteria. We review classical and recently developed methods for constructing targeted mutants in various cyanobacterial strains, and offer perspective on what genetic tools might most greatly expand the ability to engineer new functions in such strains. Similarly, we review what genetic parts are most needed for the development of cyanobacterial synthetic biology. Finally, we highlight recent methods to construct genome-scale models of cyanobacterial metabolism and to use those models to measure properties of autotrophic metabolism. Throughout this paper, we discuss some of the unique challenges of a diurnal, autotrophic lifestyle along with how the development of synthetic biology and biotechnology in cyanobacteria must fit within those constraints. © 2013 Berla, Saha, Immethun, Maranas, Moon and Pakrasi.},

The methodology utilizes biological templates and synthetic analogues to catalyse the formation of inorganic oxides. Such materials provide biocompatible environments for enzyme immobilization. The utility of the method is further enhanced by entraining and attaching encapsulated catalysts to a variety of supports.

A suspension of the organism was exposed to red light in the presence of toluidine blue, and the membrane fluidity was monitored spectrofluorimetrically by using the membrane probe trimethylammonium diphenyl hexatriene. The fluidity of the organism's cytoplasmic membrane was found to decrease significantly during lethal photosensitization, and this was accompanied by membrane condensation and vacuolation of the cells. Although changes in membrane fluidity are often attributable to lipid peroxidation, malonaldehyde (a product of lipid peroxidation) was not detectable. The disruption of membrane functions associated with a decreased membrane fluidity may contribute to the bactericidal effect of light-activated toluidine blue.},

The preferred substrate is n-hexadecane, with an optimal temperature of 37 degrees C under aerobic conditions. Five complete and two partial open reading frames were sequenced and correlated with the early steps of monoterminal oxidation-initiated n-alkane mineralization. The encoded protein sequences and the arrangement of these genes displayed high similarity to those found in Acinetobacter sp. M-1, but AR-46 seemed to have only one alkane hydroxylase gene, with a completely different induction profile. Unique behaviour was also observed in n-alkane bioavailability. Substrate uptake occurred through the hydrophobic surface of n-alkane droplet-adhered cells possessing long, thick fimbriae, which were presumed to play a major role in n-alkane solubilization. A majority of the cells was in detached form, with thick, but short fimbriae. These free cells were permanently hydrophilic, unlike the cells of other Acinetobacter strains.},

Physiologically young cells plasmolyzed with 0.5 m sucrose in 0.01 m tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer (pH 7, 8, or 9) were quantitatively converted to plasmolyzed osmotically sensitive rods after lysozyme treatment. Although such cells were osmotically sensitive, a 1:1 dilution in Tris buffer was necessary for conversion of rods into spheroplasts. Addition of EDTA resulted in a rapid conversion of the plasmolyzed spheroplasts into spherical structures devoid of a plasmolysis vacuole. These structures, which we call EDTA-lysozyme spheroplasts, contained a number of attached membranes. We believe that this conversion results from a weakening of the outer trilaminar component of the cell wall by EDTA, resulting in the collapse of the plasmolysis vacuole. Dilution of sucrose below 0.15 m also resulted in the collapse of the plasmolysis vacuole. Both the lysozyme spheroplasts and the EDTA-lysozyme spheroplasts were osmotically sensitive. Thin sections of the EDTA-lysozyme spheroplasts demonstrated that the outer trilaminar component of the cell wall was broken, exposing large areas of the cytoplasmic membrane to the environment.},

In~vivo angiogenesis assays can be costly and time-consuming, limiting their application in high-throughput studies. While traditional in~vitro assays may overcome these limitations, they lack the ability to accurately recapitulate the main elements of the tissue microenvironment found in~vivo, thereby limiting our ability to draw physiologically relevant biological conclusions. To bridge the gap between in~vivo and in~vitro angiogenesis assays, several microfluidic methods have been developed to generate in~vitro assays that incorporate blood vessel models with physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) lumen structures. However, these models have not seen widespread adoption, which can be partially attributed to the difficulty in fabricating these structures. Here, we present a simple, accessible method that takes advantage of basic fluidic principles to create 3D lumens with circular cross-sectional geometries through ECM hydrogels that are lined with endothelial monolayers to mimic the structure of blood vessels in~vitro. This technique can be used to pattern endothelial cell-lined lumens in different microchannel geometries, enabling increased flexibility for a variety of studies. We demonstrate the implementation and application of this technique to the study of angiogenesis in a physiologically relevant in~vitro setting.},

This process is mediated by periplasmic cell-wall producing enzymes that are positioned by filaments of the cytoplasmic membrane-associated actin FtsA and the tubulin FtsZ (FtsAZ). To understand how these components act in concert to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis. We find that the division septum is built at discrete sites that move around the division plane. Furthermore, FtsAZ filaments treadmill in circumferential paths around the division ring, pulling along the associated cell-wall-synthesizing enzymes. We show that the rate of FtsZ treadmilling controls both the rate of cell wall synthesis and cell division. The coupling of both the position and activity of the cell wall synthases to FtsAZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall, synthesizing increasingly small concentric rings to divide the cell.},

Much effort has been invested in merging these bacterial preservation schemes with the construction of sensor cell arrays on platforms such as biochips or optic fibres, hopefully leading to effective miniaturised whole-cell biosensor systems. These approaches hold much promise for the future.

  abstract = {The encapsulation and release of bioactive molecules from polymeric vehicles represents the holy grail of drug and growth factor delivery therapies, whereby sustained and controlled release is crucial in eliciting a positive therapeutic effect. To this end, electrospraying is rapidly emerging as a popular technology for the production of polymeric particles containing bioactive molecules. Compared with traditional emulsion fabrication techniques, electrospraying has the potential to reduce denaturation of protein drugs and affords tighter regulation over particle size distribution and morphology. In this article, we review the importance of the electrospraying parameters that enable reproducible tailoring of the particles' physical and in vitro drug release characteristics, along with discussion of existing in vivo data. Controlled morphology and monodispersity of particles can be achieved with electrospraying, with high encapsulation efficiencies and without unfavorable denaturation of bioactive molecules throughout the process. Finally, the combination of electrospraying with electrospun scaffolds, with an emphasis on tissue regeneration is reviewed, depicting a technique in its relative infancy but holding great promise for the future of regenerative medicine. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Several synthetic genetic circuits for control of multicellular patterning have been reported to date. However, hierarchical induction of gene expression domains has received little attention from synthetic biologists, despite its importance in biological self-organization. We report the first synthetic genetic system implementing population-based AND logic for programmed autonomous induction of bacterial gene expression domains. We develop a ratiometric assay for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase activity and use it to systematically characterize different intact and split enzyme variants. We then utilize the best-performing variant to build a three-color patterning system responsive to two different homoserine lactones. We validate the AND gate-like behavior of this system both in cell suspension and in surface culture. Finally, we use the synthetic circuit in a membrane-based spatial assay to demonstrate programmed hierarchical patterning of gene expression across bacterial populations.},

  abstract = {Strain diversity, while now recognized as a key driver underlying partner dynamics in symbioses, is usually difficult to experimentally manipulate and image in hosts with complex microbiota. To address this problem, we have used the luminous marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri, which establishes a symbiosis within the crypts of the nascent light organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes. Competition assays in newly hatched juvenile squid have shown that symbiotic V. fischeri are either niche-sharing “S strains”, which share the light organ when co-inoculated with other S strains, or niche-dominant “D strains”, which are typically found alone in the light organ after a co-colonization. To understand this D strain advantage, we determined the minimum time that different V. fischeri strains needed to initiate colonization and used confocal microscopy to localize the symbionts along their infection track. Further, we determined whether symbiont-induced host morphogenic events also occurred earlier during a D strain colonization. We conclude that D strains colonized more quickly than S strains. Nevertheless, light-organ populations in field-caught adult squid often contain both D and S strains. We determined experimentally that this symbiont population heterogeneity might be achieved in nature by a serial encounter of different strains in the environment.},

The cell function of the encapsulated biomass were tested in specific protein production, which is not affected by the siliceous membrane protection of Ca-alginate microcapsules. This fact, and the observed increase in mechanical stability and chemical durability, indicate that valuable features of silica encapsulation are added to those proper to Ca-alginate.},

  abstract = {Natural soil is characterized as a complex habitat with patchy hydrated islands and spatially variable nutrients that is in a constant state of change due to wetting-drying dynamics. Soil microbial activity is often concentrated in sparsely distributed hotspots that contribute dis-proportionally to macroscopic biogeochemical nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. The mechanistic representation of such dynamic hotspots requires new modeling approaches capable of representing the interplay between dynamic local conditions and the versatile microbial metabolic adaptations. We have developed IndiMeSH (Individual-based Metabolic network model for Soil Habitats) as a spatially explicit model for the physical and chemical microenvironments of soil, combined with an individual-based representation of bacterial motility and growth using adaptive metabolic networks. The model uses angular pore networks and a physically based description of the aqueous phase as a backbone for nutrient diffusion and bacterial dispersal combined with dynamic flux balance analysis to calculate growth rates depending on local nutrient conditions. To maximize computational efficiency, reduced scale metabolic networks are used for the simulation scenarios and evaluated strategically to the genome scale model. IndiMeSH was compared to a well-established population-based spatiotemporal metabolic network model (COMETS) and to experimental data of bacterial spatial organization in pore networks mimicking soil aggregates. IndiMeSH was then used to strategically study dynamic response of a bacterial community to abrupt environmental perturbations and the influence of habitat geometry and hydration conditions. Results illustrate that IndiMeSH is capable of representing trophic interactions among bacterial species, predicting the spatial organization and segregation of bacterial populations due to oxygen and carbon gradients, and provides insights into dynamic community responses as a consequence of environmental changes. The modular design of IndiMeSH and its implementation are adaptable, allowing it to represent a wide variety of experimental and in silico microbial systems.},

The structure of the catalytically inactive S679A mutant of Escherichia coli LonA protease (EcLon) has been determined by cryo-EM at the resolution of 3.5~Å. EcLonA without a bound substrate adopts a hexameric open-spiral quaternary structure that might represent the resting state of the enzyme. Upon interaction with substrate the open-spiral hexamer undergoes a major conformational change resulting in a compact, closed-circle hexamer as in the recent structure of a complex of Yersinia pestis LonA with a protein substrate. This major change is accomplished by the rigid-body rearrangement of the individual domains within the protomers of the complex around the hinge points in the interdomain linkers. Comparison of substrate-free and substrate-bound Lon structures allows to mark the location of putative pivotal points involved in such conformational changes.},

  abstract = {Biocatalytic transformations generally rely on purified enzymes or whole cells to perform complex transformations that are used on industrial scale for chemical, drug, and biofuel synthesis, pesticide decontamination, and water purification. However, both of these systems have inherent disadvantages related to the costs associated with enzyme purification, the long-term stability of immobilized enzymes, catalyst recovery, and compatibility with harsh reaction conditions. We developed a novel strategy for producing rationally designed biocatalytic surfaces based on Biofilm Integrated Nanofiber Display (BIND), which exploits the curli system of E. coli to create a functional nanofiber network capable of covalent immobilization of enzymes. This approach is attractive because it is scalable, represents a modular strategy for site-specific enzyme immobilization, and has the potential to stabilize enzymes under denaturing environmental conditions. We site-specifically immobilized a recombinant -amylase, fused to the SpyCatcher attachment domain, onto E. coli curli fibers displaying complementary SpyTag capture domains. We characterized the effectiveness of this immobilization technique on the biofilms and tested the stability of immobilized -amylase in unfavorable conditions. This enzyme-modified biofilm maintained its activity when exposed to a wide range of pH and organic solvent conditions. In contrast to other biofilm-based catalysts, which rely on high cellular metabolism, the modified curli-based biofilm remained active even after cell death due to organic solvent exposure. This work lays the foundation for a new and versatile method of using the extracellular polymeric matrix of E. coli for creating novel biocatalytic surfaces.},

  abstract = {Metabolism mediates the flow of matter and energy through the biosphere. We examined how metabolic evolution shapes ecosystems by reconstructing it in the globally abundant oceanic phytoplankter Prochlorococcus. To understand what drove observed evolutionary patterns, we interpreted them in the context of its population dynamics, growth rate, and light adaptation, and the size and macromolecular and elemental composition of cells. This multilevel view suggests that, over the course of evolution, there was a steady increase in Prochlorococcus' metabolic rate and excretion of organic carbon. We derived a mathematical framework that suggests these adaptations lower the minimal subsistence nutrient concentration of cells, which results in a drawdown of nutrients in oceanic surface waters. This, in turn, increases total ecosystem biomass and promotes the coevolution of all cells in the ecosystem. Additional reconstructions suggest that Prochlorococcus and the dominant cooccurring heterotrophic bacterium SAR11 form a coevolved mutualism that maximizes their collective metabolic rate by recycling organic carbon through complementary excretion and uptake pathways. Moreover, the metabolic codependencies of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 are highly similar to those of chloroplasts and mitochondria within plant cells. These observations lead us to propose a general theory relating metabolic evolution to the self-amplification and self-organization of the biosphere. We discuss the implications of this framework for the evolution of Earth's biogeochemical cycles and the rise of atmospheric oxygen.},

Since often no a priori knowledge of relevant toxicants exists, chemical analysis alone is not an appropriate tool for hazard assessment. Instead, a linkage of effect data and hazardous compounds is required. For that purpose, effect-directed analysis (EDA) was developed, which is based on a combination of biotesting, fractionation procedures and chemical analytical methods. Since a controversial discussion about the prospects of success in relation to the expense exists, the current methodological state of EDA for organic toxicants in complex mixtures and important results are reviewed in this paper with the aim of establishing criteria for the successful use of this promising tool. While EDA is a powerful tool to identify specifically acting individual toxicants close to the source of emission, it is inappropriate for screening purposes and often may fail in remote areas where the concentrations of specific toxicants are too low relative to the nonspecific toxicity of the whole mixture of natural and anthropogenic compounds. The biological tools have to be carefully selected with respect to their ability to detect specific effects and their significance in hazard assessment. Sophisticated chemical tools are required to identify individual toxicants in mixtures of thousands of compounds, which are typical for contaminated environments.},

Given the complexity of signal processing that occurs in natural biological systems, engineered microbes have the potential to perform a wide range of desirable tasks that require sophisticated computation and control. Realising this goal will require accurate predictive design of complex synthetic gene circuits and accompanying large sets of quality modular and orthogonal genetic parts. Here we present a current overview of the versatile components and tools available for engineering gene circuits in microbes, including recently developed RNA-based tools that possess large dynamic ranges and can be easily programmed. We introduce design principles that enable robust and scalable circuit performance such as insulating a gene circuit against unwanted interactions with its context, and we describe efficient strategies for rapidly identifying and correcting causes of failure and fine-tuning circuit characteristics.},

  abstract = {Organic pollutants (e.g. polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) strongly sorb to carbonaceous sorbents such as black carbon and activated carbon (BC and AC, respectively). For a creosote-contaminated soil (Σ15PAH 5500 mg kgdry weight (dw)- 1) and an urban soil with moderate PAH content (Σ15PAH 38 mg kgdw- 1), total organic carbon-water distribution coefficients (KTOC) were up to a factor of 100 above values for amorphous (humic) organic carbon obtained by a frequently used Linear-Free-Energy Relationship. This increase could be explained by inclusion of BC (urban soil) or oil (creosote-contaminated soil) into the sorption model. AC is a manufactured sorbent for organic pollutants with similar strong sorption properties as the combustion by-product BC. AC has the potential to be used for in situ remediation of contaminated soils and sediments. The addition of small amounts of powdered AC (2\%) to the moderately contaminated urban soil reduced the freely dissolved aqueous concentration of native PAH in soil/water suspensions up to 99\%. For granulated AC amended to the urban soil, the reduction in freely dissolved concentrations was not as strong (median 64\%), especially for the heavier PAH. This is probably due to blockage of the pore system of granulated AC resulting in AC deactivation by soil components. For powdered and granulated AC amended to the heavily contaminated creosote soil, median reductions were 63\% and 4\%, respectively, probably due to saturation of AC sorption sites by the high PAH concentrations and/or blockage of sorption sites and pores by oil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the success in employing genome-scale modeling coupled with flux balance analysis to engineer heterotrophic metabolism, the lack of proper constraints necessary to generate biologically realistic predictions has hindered broad application of this methodology to phototrophic metabolism. Here we describe a methodology for constraining genome-scale models of photoautotrophy in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Experimental photophysiology parameters coupled to genome-scale flux balance analysis resulted in accurate predictions of growth rates and metabolic reaction fluxes at low and high light conditions. Additionally, by constraining photon uptake fluxes, we characterized the metabolic cost of excess excitation energy. The predicted energy fluxes were consistent with known light-adapted phenotypes in cyanobacteria. Finally, we leveraged the modeling framework to characterize existing photoautotrophic and photomixtotrophic engineering strategies for 2,3-butanediol production in S. elongatus. This methodology, applicable to genome-scale modeling of all phototrophic microorganisms, can facilitate the use of flux balance analysis in the engineering of light-driven metabolism.},

  abstract = {The model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, is a genetically tractable obligate phototroph that is being developed for the bioproduction of high-value chemicals. Genome-scale models (GEMs) have been successfully used to assess and engineer cellular metabolism; however, GEMs of phototrophic metabolism have been limited by the lack of experimental datasets for model validation and the challenges of incorporating photon uptake. Here, we develop a GEM of metabolism in S. elongatus using random barcode transposon site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) essential gene and physiological data specific to photoautotrophic metabolism. The model explicitly describes photon absorption and accounts for shading, resulting in the characteristic linear growth curve of photoautotrophs. GEM predictions of gene essentiality were compared with data obtained from recent dense-transposon mutagenesis experiments. This dataset allowed major improvements to the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, discrepancies between GEM predictions and the in vivo dataset revealed biological characteristics, such as the importance of a truncated, linear TCA pathway, low flux toward amino acid synthesis from photo-respiration, and knowledge gaps within nucleotide metabolism. Coupling of strong experimental support and photoautotrophic modeling methods thus resulted in a highly accurate model of S. elongatus metabolism that highlights previously unknown areas of S. elongatus biology.},

The gels were characterized by the equilibrium degree of swelling as a function of pH, modulus of elasticity in compression at pH 2 and 7.4 and permeability of insulin at pH 2 and 7.4. It was found that the structure of the polymer backbone influenced the pH-dependent swelling. In all cases, the degree of swelling was lower at pH 2 than at 7.4. As the degree of swelling decreased, the modulus of elasticity was found to increase and the permeability of insulin decreased. These gels are enzymatically degradable by microbial azoreductases present in the colon and have a potential use in site-specific drug delivery to the colon.},

However, with growing populations, global warming and contamination due to human activity, it is one that is increasingly under threat. It is hoped that nature can inspire the creation of materials to aid in the supply and management of water, from water collection and purification to water source clean-up and rehabilitation from oil contamination. Many species thrive in even the driest places, with some surviving on water harvested from fog. By studying these species, new materials can be developed to provide a source of fresh water from fog for communities across the globe. The vast majority of water on the Earth is in the oceans. However, current desalination processes are energy-intensive. Systems in our own bodies have evolved to transport water efficiently while blocking other molecules and ions. Inspiration can be taken from such to improve the efficiency of desalination and help purify water containing other contaminants. Finally, oil contamination of water from spills or the fracking technique can be a devastating environmental disaster. By studying how natural surfaces interact with liquids, new techniques can be developed to clean up oil spills and further protect our most precious resource.This article is part of the themed issue 'Bioinspired hierarchically structured surfaces for green science'.},

  abstract = {The design of hybrid mesoporous materials incorporating polymeric assemblies as versatile functional units has become a very fertile research area offering major opportunities for controlling molecular transport through interfaces. However, the creation of such functional materials depends critically on our ability to assemble polymeric units in a predictable manner within mesopores with dimensions comparable to the size of the macromolecular blocks themselves. In this work, we describe for the first time the manipulation of the molecular transport properties of mesoporous silica thin films by the direct infiltration of polyelectrolytes into the inner environment of the 3D porous framework. The hybrid architectures were built up through the infiltration-electrostatic assembly of polyallylamine (PAH) on the mesopore silica walls, and the resulting systems were studied by a combination of experimental techniques including ellipso-porosimetry, cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, among others. Our results show that the infiltration-assembly of PAH alters the intrinsic cation-permselective properties of mesoporous silica films, rendering them ion-permeable mesochannels and enabling the unrestricted diffusion of cationic and anionic species through the hybrid interfacial architecture. Contrary to what happens during the electrostatic assembly of PAH on planar silica films (quantitative charge reversal), the surface charge of the mesoporous walls is completely neutralized upon assembling the cationic PAH layer (i.e., no charge reversal occurs). We consider this work to have profound implications not only on the molecular design of multifunctional mesoporous thin films but also on understanding the predominant role of nanoconfinement effects in dictating the functional properties of polymer-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials.},

To investigate its mode of action we generated strains of the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 in which Vipp1 was tagged with green fluorescent protein at the C-terminus and expressed from the native chromosomal locus. There was little perturbation of function. Live-cell fluorescence imaging shows dramatic relocalisation of Vipp1 under high light. Under low light, Vipp1 is predominantly dispersed in the cytoplasm with occasional concentrations at the outer periphery of the thylakoid membranes. High light induces Vipp1 coalescence into localised puncta within minutes, with net relocation of Vipp1 to the vicinity of the cytoplasmic membrane and the thylakoid membranes. Pull-downs and mass spectrometry identify an extensive collection of proteins that are directly or indirectly associated with Vipp1 only after high-light exposure. These include not only photosynthetic and stress-related proteins but also RNA-processing, translation and protein assembly factors. This suggests that the Vipp1 puncta could be involved in protein assembly. One possibility is that Vipp1 is involved in the formation of stress-induced localised protein assembly centres, enabling enhanced protein synthesis and delivery to membranes under stress conditions.},

This review summarizes process implementation aspects for the in vivo application of the especially versatile enzyme class of oxygenases, capable of specifically introducing oxygen from molecular oxygen into a large range of organic molecules. Critical issues such as reaching high enzyme activity and specificity, product degradation, cofactor recycling, reactant toxicity, and substrate and oxygen mass transfer can be overcome by biochemical process engineering and biocatalyst engineering. Both strategies provide a growing toolset to facilitate process implementation, optimization, and scale-up. Major advances were achieved via heterologous overexpression of oxygenase genes, directed evolution, metabolic engineering, and in situ product removal. Process examples from industry and academia show that the combined use of different concepts enables efficient oxygenase-based whole-cell catalysis of various commercially interesting reactions such as the biosynthesis of chiral compounds, the specific oxyfunctionalization of complex molecules, and also the synthesis of medium-priced chemicals. Better understanding of the cell metabolism and future developments in both biocatalyst and bioprocess engineering are expected to promote the implementation of many and various industrial biooxidation processes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract: The sorption and irreversible binding of naphthalene and -naphthol to two sandy soils were evaluated. To determine the extent that biologically-mediated oxidative coupling contributed to the irreversible binding of -naphthol, the presence/absence of O2 and the presence/absence of biological activity were varied during the sorption period to operationally define biological coupling conditions. After a 2-d sorption period, sorbed material was removed by successive water and solvent extractions, alkali extractions, and combustion. Nonextracted material was defined as the amount of test compound remaining after solvent extraction (QNONEX). Naphthalene that was not extracted after the 2-d sorption period was caused by mass transfer-limited entrapment within micropores and was used to estimate the fraction of entrapped -naphthol. The principle of superposition was applied to the -naphthol results to determine the contribution of individual irreversible binding processes. Biologically-mediated oxidative coupling accounted for 49.4 Â± 15.0\% of QNONEX of -naphthol. Oxidative coupling catalyzed by mineral surfaces accounted for 40.5 Â± 15.8\% of QNONEX of -naphthol. Over contact times up to 200 d, nonextracted naphthalene increased from 1.6\% to 11.7\% of the initially sorbed material, coincident with the biological production of a more polar metabolite.},

  abstract = {Nanomechanical resonators enable the measurement of mass with extraordinary sensitivity. Previously, samples as light as 7 zeptograms (1 zg = 10 -21 g) have been weighed in vacuum, and proton-level resolution seems to be within reach. Resolving small mass changes requires the resonator to be light and to ring at a very pure tone - that is, with a high quality factor. In solution, viscosity severely degrades both of these characteristics, thus preventing many applications in nanotechnology and the life sciences where fluid is required. Although the resonant structure can be designed to minimize viscous loss, resolution is still substantially degraded when compared to measurements made in air or vacuum. An entirely different approach eliminates viscous damping by placing the solution inside a hollow resonator that is surrounded by vacuum. Here we demonstrate that suspended microchannel resonators can weigh single nanoparticles, single bacterial cells and sub-monolayers of adsorbed proteins in water with sub-femtogram resolution (1 Hz bandwidth). Central to these results is our observation that viscous loss due to the fluid is negligible compared to the intrinsic damping of our silicon crystal resonator. The combination of the low resonator mass (100 ng) and high quality factor (15,000) enables an improvement in mass resolution of six orders of magnitude over a high-end commercial quartz crystal microbalance. This gives access to intriguing applications, such as mass-based flow cytometry, the direct detection of pathogens, or the non-optical sizing and mass density measurement of colloidal particles. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

A fragment from plasmid NAH7, which contains the promoter for the upper pathway of degradation, was transcriptionally fused to the lux genes of Vibrio fischeri. A Pseudomonas strain containing this construction is inducible to high levels of light production in the presence of a suitable substrate and the nahR regulatory gene product. This system was used to examine catabolic activity in a unique manner under a variety of growth conditions. Induction of bioluminescence was demonstrated to coincide with naphthalene degradation in all cases through the use of mineralization assays. A significant delay in bioluminescence and biodegradation was observed when naphthalene was added to batch cultures that were growing exponentially. These results suggest that the metabolism of naphthalene by this Pseudomonas strain is optimal when the growth rate of the culture is slow and is greatly reduced during exponential growth.},

  abstract = {Synthetic microbial cocultures carry enormous potential for applied biotechnology and are increasingly the subject of fundamental research. So far, most cocultures have been designed and characterized based on bulk cultivations without considering the potentially highly heterogeneous and diverse single-cell behavior. However, an in-depth understanding of cocultures including their interacting single cells is indispensable for the development of novel cultivation approaches and control of cocultures. We present the development, validation, and experimental characterization of an optochemically controllable bacterial coculture on a microcolony level consisting of two Corynebacterium glutamicum strains. Our coculture combines an L-lysine auxotrophic strain together with a L-lysine-producing variant carrying the genetically IPTG-mediated induction of L-lysine production. We implemented two control approaches utilizing IPTG as inducer molecule. First, unmodified IPTG was supplemented to the culture enabling a medium-based control of the production of L-lysine, which serves as the main interacting component. Second, optochemical control was successfully performed by utilizing photocaged IPTG activated by appropriate illumination. Both control strategies were validated studying cellular growth on a microcolony level. The novel microfluidic single-cell cultivation strategies applied in this work can serve as a blueprint to validate cellular control strategies of synthetic mono-and cocultures with single-cell resolution at defined environmental conditions.},

The reaction between ferrous iron, very abundant in the reductive early atmosphere, and oxygen results in the formation of harmful superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, which affect all macromolecules (DNA, lipids and proteins). Living organisms have to build up mechanisms to protect themselves against oxidative stress, with enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase, small proteins like thioredoxin and glutaredoxin, and molecules such as glutathione. Bacterial genetic responses to oxidative stress are controlled by two major transcriptional regulators (OxyR and SoxRS). This paper reviews major key points in the generation of reactive oxygen species in bacteria, defense mechanisms and genetic responses to oxidative stress.

Gene clusters encoding diverse BMCs are distributed broadly across bacterial phyla, providing a rich variety of building blocks with a predicted range of permeability properties. In theory, shell permeability can be engineered by modifying residues flanking the pores (symmetry axes) of hexameric shell proteins or by combining shell proteins from different types of BMCs into chimeric shells.

Two types of shell protein constituents are common to carboxysomes and related microcompartments of heterotrophic bacteria, and the genes for these proteins are found in a large variety of bacteria. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have created a Halothiobacillus neapolitanus knockout mutant that does not produce the two paralogous CsoS4 proteins thought to occupy the vertices of the icosahedral carboxysomes and related microcompartments. Biochemical and ultrastructural analyses indicated that the mutant predominantly forms carboxysomes of normal appearance, in addition to some elongated microcompartments. Despite their normal shape, purified mutant carboxysomes are functionally impaired, although the activities of the encapsulated enzymes are not negatively affected. Conclusions/Significance: In the absence of the CsoS4 proteins the carboxysome shell loses its limited permeability to CO2 and is no longer able to provide the catalytic advantage RubisCO derives from microcompartmentalization. This study presents direct evidence that the diffusion barrier property of the carboxysome shell contributes significantly to the biological function of the carboxysome. © 2009 Cai et al.},

In this work, we expanded our synthetic riboregulation platform into a genetic switchboard that independently controls the expression of multiple genes in parallel. First, we designed and characterized riboregulator variants to complete the foundation of the genetic switchboard; then we constructed the switchboard sensor, a testing platform that reported on quorum-signaling molecules, DNA damage, iron starvation, and extracellular magnesium concentration in single cells. As a demonstration of the biotechnological potential of our synthetic device, we built a metabolism switchboard that regulated four metabolic genes, pgi, zwf, edd, and gnd, to control carbon flow through three Escherichia coli glucose-utilization pathways: the Embden-Meyerhof, Entner-Doudoroff, and pentose phosphate pathways. We provide direct evidence for switchboard-mediated shunting of metabolic flux by measuring mRNA levels of the riboregulated genes, shifts in the activities of the relevant enzymes and pathways, and targeted changes to the E. coli metabolome. The design, testing, and implementation of the genetic switchboard illustrate the successful construction of a higher-order systemthat can be used for a broad range of practical applications in synthetic biology and biotechnology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyanobacteria are solar-powered prokaryotes useful for sustainable production of valuable molecules, but orthogonal and regulated promoters are lacking. The Lac repressor (LacI) from Escherichia coli is a well-studied transcription factor that is orthogonal to cyanobacteria and represses transcription by binding a primary lac operator (lacO), blocking RNA-polymerase. Repression can be enhanced through DNA-looping, when a LacI-tetramer binds two spatially separated lacO and loops the DNA. Ptrc is a commonly used LacI-repressed promoter that is inefficiently repressed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. Ptrc2O, a version of Ptrc with two lacO, is more efficiently repressed, indicating DNA-looping. To investigate the inefficient repression of Ptrc and cyanobacterial DNA-looping, we designed a Ptrc-derived promoter library consisting of single lacO promoters, including a version of Ptrc with a stronger lacO (Ptrc1O-proximal), and dual lacO promoters with varying inter-lacO distances (the Ptrc2O-library).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: We first characterized artificial constitutive promoters and used one for engineering a LacI-expressing strain of Synechocystis. Using this strain, we observed that Ptrc1O-proximal is similar to Ptrc in being inefficiently repressed. Further, the Ptrc2O-library displays a periodic repression pattern that remains for both non- and induced conditions and decreases with longer inter-lacO distances, in both E. coli and Synechocystis. Repression of Ptrc2O-library promoters with operators out of phase is less efficient in Synechocystis than in E. coli, whereas repression of promoters with lacO in phase is efficient even under induced conditions in Synechocystis. Two well-repressed Ptrc2O promoters were highly active when tested in absence of LacI in Synechocystis.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The artificial constitutive promoters herein characterized can be utilized for expression in cyanobacteria, as demonstrated for LacI. The inefficient repression of Ptrc and Ptrc1O-proximal in Synechocystis, as compared to E. coli, may be due to insufficient LacI expression, or differences in RNAP subunits. DNA-looping works as a transcriptional regulation mechanism similarly as in E. coli. DNA-looping contributes strongly to Ptrc2O-library repression in Synechocystis, even though they contain the weakly-repressed primary lacO of Ptrc1O-proximal and relatively low levels of LacI/cell. Hence, Synechocystis RNAP may be more sensitive to DNA-looping than E. coli RNAP, and/or the chromatin torsion resistance could be lower. Two strong and highly repressed Ptrc2O promoters could be used without induction, or together with an unstable LacI.},

  abstract = {Redox-sensitive variants of the green fluorescent protein (roGFPs) had previously been developed that allow "real-time" monitoring of the redox status of cellular compartments by fluorescence excitation ratiometry. However, the response time of these probes limits the study of certain rapid oxidative events, such as H2O2 bursts in cell signaling. The substitution of up to three positively charged amino acids adjacent to the introduced disulfide in roGFP1 (variants designated roGFP1-R1 through -R14) substantially improved the response rate. The pseudo first-order rate constants for oxidation by H2O2 and reduction by DTT and redox midpoint potentials were determined. The rate constants approximately doubled with each additional positively charged substitution, to nearly an order of magnitude total. The midpoint potentials are highly correlated with the rate increases, becoming more oxidizing with increasing numbers of positive substitutions. Crystal structures of two variants with opposite disulfide oxidation states have been determined: a 2.2 A resolution structure of oxidized "R7" containing two basic substitutions, and a 1.95 A resolution structure of reduced "R8" with one basic and one acidic substitution. Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations are shown to accurately predict the effects of the substitutions on the rate constants. The effects of the substitutions on dimer formation, relative oxidative midpoint potentials, and oxidation and reduction rates are discussed. roGFPs are demonstrated to constitute an excellent model system for quantitative analysis of factors influencing thiol transfer reactions. roGFP1-R12 is most suitable for use in live cells, due to significantly increased reaction rate and increased pI.},

  abstract = {Noble metal nanoparticle-based localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is an advanced and powerful label-free biosensing technique which is well-known for its high sensitivity to the surrounding refractive index change in the local environment caused by the biomolecular interactions around the sensing area. The characteristics of the LSPR effect in such sensors are highly dependent on the size, shape and nature of the material properties of the metallic nanoparticles considered. Among the various types of metallic nanoparticles used in studies employing the LSPR technique, the use of gold nanorods (GNRs) has attracted particular attention for the development of sensitive LSPR biosensors, this arising from the unique and intriguing optical properties of the material. This paper provides a detailed review of the key underpinning science for such systems and of recent progress in the development of a number of LSPR-based biosensors which use GNR as the active element, including an overview of the sensing principle, the synthesis of GNRs, the fabrication of a number of biosensors, techniques for surface modification of GNRs and finally their performance in several biosensing applications. The review ends with a consideration of key advances in GNR-based LSPR sensing and prospects for future research and advances for the development of the GNR-based LSPR biosensors. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Modeling studies predict that QS may operate at the level of a single cell, but, owing to experimental challenges, the potential benefits of QS by individual cells remain virtually unexplored. Here we report a physical system that mimics isolation of a bacterium, such as within an endosome or phagosome during infection, and maintains cell viability under conditions of complete chemical and physical isolation. For Staphylococcus aureus, we show that quorum sensing and genetic reprogramming can occur in a single isolated organism. Quorum sensing allows S. aureus to sense confinement and to activate virulence and metabolic pathways needed for survival. To demonstrate the benefit of confinement-induced quorum sensing to individuals, we showed that quorum-sensing bacteria have significantly greater viability over non-QS bacteria.},

The challenge has in large part been due to the variability of chromosomal gene expression, which has only recently been shown to be affected by multiple factors, including the local genomic context. In this work we utilize Tn5 transposase to randomly integrate a three-gene csc operon encoding nonphosphotransferase sucrose catabolism into the E. coli K-12 chromosome. Isolates from the transposon library yielded a range of growth rates on sucrose as the sole carbon source, including some that were comparable to that of E. coli K-12 on glucose (μmax = 0.70 ± 0.03 h-1). Narrowness of the growth rate distributions and faster growth compared to plasmids indicate that efficient csc expression is attainable. Furthermore, enhanced growth rate upon transduction into strains that underwent adaptive laboratory evolution indicate that sucrose catabolism is not limiting to cellular growth. We also show that transduction of a csc fast-growth locus into an isobutanol production strain yields high titer (7.56 ± 0.25 g/L) on sucrose as the sole carbon source. Our results demonstrate that random integration is an effective strategy for optimizing heterologous expression within the context of cellular metabolism for both fast growth and biochemical production phenotypes.},

We visualized the native arrangement and dense packing of photosystem I (PSI), photosystem II (PSII), and cytochrome (Cyt) b6f within thylakoid membranes at the molecular level. Furthermore, we functionally tagged PSI, PSII, Cyt b6f, and ATP synthase individually with fluorescent proteins, and revealed the heterogeneous distribution of these four photosynthetic complexes and determined their dynamic features within the crowding membrane environment using live-cell fluorescence imaging. We characterized red light-induced clustering localization and adjustable diffusion of photosynthetic complexes in thylakoid membranes, representative of the reorganization of photosynthetic apparatus in response to environmental changes. Understanding the organization and dynamics of photosynthetic membranes is essential for rational design and construction of artificial photosynthetic systems to underpin bioenergy development. Knowledge of cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes could also be extended to other cell membranes, such as chloroplast and mitochondrial membranes.

  abstract = {This review summarizes what is known regarding cell division in cyanobacteria, the fascinating microorganisms that are logically attracting a growing attention in various areas of basic and applied researches. Cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, colonize most water and soil environments of our planet, and provide a large part of the oxygenic atmosphere and biomass for the food chain. They display different morphologies ranging from unicellular (cylindrical, spherical and spirals) to complex multi-cellular (filamentous) forms that contain differentiated cells allowing the growth or survival of these organisms under adverse conditions. Furthermore, cyanobacteria divide in one or several successive planes, at right angles or in irregular planes so that the cells may appear singly or in aggregates of varying size. Nowadays, cyanobacteria are regarded as promising "low-cost" microbial cell factories for carbon capture and storage, and for the sustainable production of secondary metabolites and biofuels, thanks to their simple nutritional requirements, their metabolic plasticity, and the powerful genetics of some model strains. In this chapter, we report that cyanobacteria (which are Gram negative) share cytokinetic genes in common with both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, and/or the chloroplast and the nuclear genome of plants and algae. In agreement with cyanobacteria being regarded as the ancestor of the chloroplast, the stromal portion of the chloroplast division complex resemble the cyanobacterial cell division machinery, but many other components were lost after the endosymbiotic event.},

  abstract = {Membrane fusion is essential for cell survival and has attracted a great deal of both theoretical and experimental interest. Fluorescence (de)quenching measurements were designed to distinguish between bilayermerging and vesicle-mixing. Theoretical studies and various microscopic and diffraction methods have elucidated the mechanism of membrane fusion. These have revealed that membrane proximity and high defect density in the adjacent bilayers are the only prerequisites for fusion. Intermediates, such as stalk or inverse micellar structures can, but need not, be involved in vesicle fusion. Nonlamellar phase creation is accompanied by massive membrane fusion although it is not a requirement for bilayer merging. Propensity for membrane fusion is increased by increasing the local membrane disorder as well by performing manipulations that bring bilayers closer together. Membrane rigidification and enlarged bilayer separation opposes this trend. Membrane fusion is promoted by defects created in the bilayer due to the vicinity of lipid phase transition, lateral phase separation or domain generation, high local membrane curvature, osmotic or electric stress in or on the membrane; the addition of amphiphats or macromolecules which insert themselves into the membrane, freezing or other mechanical membrane perturbation have similar effects. Lowering the water activity by the addition of water soluble polymers or by partial system dehydration invokes membrane aggregation and hence facilitates fusion; as does the membrane charge neutralization after proton or other ion binding to the lipids and intermembrane scaffolding by proteins or other macromolecules. The alignment of defect rich domains and polypeptides or protein binding is pluripotent: not only does it increase the number of proximal defects in the bilayers, it triggers the vesicle aggregation and is fusogenic. Exceptions are the bound molecules that create steric or electrical barriers between the membranes which prevent fusion. Membrane fusion can be non-leaky but it is very common to lose material from the vesicle interior during the later stages of membrane unification, that is, after a few hundred microseconds following the induction of fusion.},

It is well-known that spatially-structured environments slow the rate of adaptation due to increased intra-genotype competition. Here, we show that this effect magnifies over time as a species becomes better adapted and grows faster. Using a reaction-diffusion model, we demonstrate that growth rates are inextricably coupled with effective spatial scales, such that higher growth rates cause more localized competition. This has two effects: selection requires more generations for beneficial mutations to fix, and spatially-caused genetic drift increases. Together, these effects diminish the value of additional growth rate mutations in structured environments.},

It is therefore important to quantitatively understand how spatial proximity affects interactions in different environments. We tested how proximity influences colony size when either Escherichia coli or Salmonella enterica are grown on various carbon sources. The importance of colony location changed with species and carbon source. Spatially explicit, genome-scale metabolic modeling recapitulated observed colony size variation. Competitors that determine territory size, according to Voronoi diagrams, were the most important drivers of variation in colony size. However, the relative importance of different competitors changed through time. Further, the effect of location increased when colonies took up resources quickly relative to the diffusion of limiting resources. These analyses made it apparent that the importance of location was smaller than expected for experiments with S. enterica growing on glucose. The accumulation of toxic byproducts appeared to limit the growth of large colonies and reduced variation in colony size. Our work provides an experimentally and theoretically grounded understanding of how location interacts with metabolism and diffusion to influence microbial interactions.},

Most PAHs are hydrophobic with high boiling and melting points and high electrochemical stability, but with low water solubility. Compared with other PAH species, naphthalene has less toxicity and is easily found in the environment. Thus, naphthalene is usually adopted as a model compound to examine the environmental and health aspects of PAHs. This study attempted to use an adsorption process to remove naphthalene from a water environment. The adsorption equilibrium of naphthalene on zeolite from water-butanol solution, which is a surfactant-enriched scrubbing liquid, was successfully evaluated by Langmuir, Freundlich, and linear isotherms. Among the tested kinetics models in this study (e.g., pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Elovich rate equations), the pseudo-second-order equation successfully predicted the adsorption. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The microspheres were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and optical and electron microscopy, and the effects of the processing parameters (flow-rate ratio, polymer concentration and applied voltage) on the mean microsphere diameter (D) and shell thickness (t) were determined. It was found that the mean diameters of the hollow microspheres could be controlled in the range from 310 to 1000 nm while the corresponding mean shell thickness varied from 40 to 95 nm. The results indicate that the ratio D : t varied with polymer concentration, with the largest value of approximately 10 achieved with a solution containing 18 wt\% of the polymer, while the smallest value (6.6) was obtained at 36 wt\%.

  abstract = {Nutrient uptake and waste excretion are among the many important functions of the cellular membrane. While permitting nutrients into the cell, the cellular membrane system evolves to guide against noxious agents present in the environment from entering the intracellular milieu. The semipermeable nature of the membrane is at odds with biomolecular engineers in their endeavor of using microbes as cell factory. The cellular membrane often retards the entry of substrate into the cellular systems and prevents the product from being released from the cellular system for an easy recovery. Consequently, productivities of whole-cell bioprocesses such as biocatalysis, fermentation, and bioremediations are severely compromised. For example, the rate of whole-cell biocatalysis is usually 1-2 orders of magnitude slower than that of the isolated enzymes. When product export cannot keep pace with the production rate, intracellular product accumulation quickly leads to a halt of production due to product inhibition. While permeabilization via chemical or physical treatment of cell membrane is effective in small-scale process, large-scale implementation is problematic. Molecular engineering approach recently emerged as a much better alternative. Armed with increasingly sophisticated tools, biomolecular engineers are following nature's ingenuity to derive satisfactory solutions to the permeability problem. This review highlights these exciting molecular engineering achievements.},

In Synechococcuselongatus, the carbon-fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is concentrated into polyhedral, proteinaceous compartments called carboxysomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using live cell fluorescence microscopy, we show that carboxysomes are first detected as small seeds of RuBisCO that colocalize with existing carboxysomes. These seeds contain little or no shell protein, but increase in RuBisCO content over several hours, during which time they are exposed to the solvent. The maturing seed is then enclosed by shell proteins, a rapid process that seals RuBisCO from the cytosol to establish a distinct, solvent-protected microenvironment that is oxidizing relative to the cytosol. These closure events can be spatially and temporally coincident with the appearance of a nascent daughter RuBisCO seed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Carboxysomes assemble in a stepwise fashion, inside-to-outside, revealing that cargo is the principle organizer of this compartment's biogenesis. Our observations of the spatial relationship of seeds to previously formed carboxysomes lead us to propose a model for carboxysome replication via sequential fission, polymerization, and encapsulation of their internal cargo.},

Determination of optimal reaction conditions showed that the immobilized cells took on increased activity at a higher pH and temperature. However, the cells entrapped in methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) gel matrix gave a lower activity as compared to that of the free cells. Our experimental results indicate that the sol–gel entrapment based on silica matrixes was a simple, efficient and cost-efficient method for the immobilization the whole cells of Methylomonas sp. strain GYJ3 cells.}

  abstract = {A challenge of synthetic biology is the creation of cooperative microbial systems that exhibit population-level behaviors. Such systems use cellular signaling mechanisms to regulate gene expression across multiple cell types. We describe the construction of a synthetic microbial consortium consisting of two distinct cell types—an “activator” strain and a “repressor” strain. These strains produced two orthogonal cell-signaling molecules that regulate gene expression within a synthetic circuit spanning both strains. The two strains generated emergent, population-level oscillations only when cultured together. Certain network topologies of the two-strain circuit were better at maintaining robust oscillations than others. The ability to program population-level dynamics through the genetic engineering of multiple cooperative strains points the way toward engineering complex synthetic tissues and organs with multiple cell types.},

  abstract = {Carbon fixation in cyanobacteria makes a major contribution to the global carbon cycle. The cyanobacterial carboxysome is a proteinaceous microcompartment that protects and concentrates the carbon-fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) in a paracrystalline lattice, making it possible for these organisms to fix CO2 from the atmosphere. The protein responsible for the organization of this lattice in beta-type carboxysomes of the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, CcmM, occurs in two isoforms thought to localize differentially within the carboxysome matrix. Here we use wide-field time-lapse and three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to study the recruitment and localization of these two isoforms. We demonstrate that this superresolution technique is capable of distinguishing the localizations of the outer protein shell of the carboxysome and its internal cargo. We develop an automated analysis pipeline to analyze and quantify 3D-SIM images and generate a population-level description of the carboxysome shell protein, RuBisCO, and CcmM isoform localization. We find that both CcmM isoforms have similar spatial and temporal localization, prompting a revised model of the internal arrangement of the β-carboxysome.},

Recent advances in enzyme engineering have used a combination of these random methods of directed evolution with elements of rational enzyme modification to successfully by-pass certain limitations of both directed evolution and rational design. Semi-rational approaches that target multiple, specific residues to mutate on the basis of prior structural or functional knowledge create 'smart' libraries that are more likely to yield positive results. Efficient sampling of mutations likely to affect enzyme function has been conducted both experimentally and, on a much greater scale, computationally, with remarkable improvements in substrate selectivity and specificity and in the de novo design of enzyme activities within scaffolds of known structure. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {As greater quantities of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) enter the environment, they will have an increasingly important effect on the availability and transport of aqueous contaminants. As a consequence of purification, deliberate surface functionalization, and/or exposure to oxidizing agents after release to the environment, CNTs often contain surface oxides (i.e., oxygen containing functional groups). To probe the influence that surface oxides exert on CNT sorption properties, multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) with varying oxygen concentrations were studied with respect to their sorption properties toward naphthalene. For pristine (as-received) MWCNTs, the sorption capacity was intermediate between that of a natural char and a granular activated carbon. Sorption data also reveal that a linear relationship exists between the oxygen content of MWCNTs and their maximum adsorption capacity for naphthalene, with 10\% surface oxygen concentration resulting in a roughly 70\% decrease in maximum adsorption capacity. The relative distribution of sorption energies, as characterized by Freundlich isotherm exponents was, however, unaffected by oxidation. Thus, the data are consistent with the idea that incorporated surface oxides create polar regions that reduce the surface area available for naphthalene sorption. These results highlight the important role of surface chemistry in controlling the environmental properties of CNTs.},

In the present study, an X-ray crystal structure of the CAH-barbituric acid inhibitor complex from Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS 571 has been determined at 2.7 ÃƒÂ resolution. The CAH protein fold consists of three structurally homologous domains forming a ÃÂ²-barrel-like structure with external ÃÂ±-helices that result in a three-fold symmetry, a dominant feature of the structure and active site that mirrors the three-fold symmetrical shape of the substrate cyanuric acid. The active site structure of CAH is similar to that of the recently determined AtzD with three pairs of active site Ser-Lys dyads. In order to determine the role of each Ser-Lys dyad in catalysis, a mutational study using a highly sensitive, enzyme-coupled assay was conducted. The 109-fold loss of activity by the S226A mutant was at least ten times lower than that of the S79A and S333A mutants. In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed the Ser226/Lys156 dyad as the only absolutely conserved dyad in the CAH/barbiturase family. These data suggest that Lys156 activates the Ser226 nucleophile which can then attack the substrate carbonyl. Our combination of structural, mutational, and bioinformatics analyses differentiates this study and provides experimental data for mechanistic insights into this unique protein family.

  abstract = {Bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) are sophisticated protein-based organelles used to optimize metabolic pathways. They consist of metabolic enzymes encapsulated within a protein shell, which creates an ideal environment for catalysis and facilitates the channeling of toxic/volatile intermediates to downstream enzymes. The metabolic processes that require MCPs are diverse and widely distributed and play important roles in global carbon fixation and bacterial pathogenesis. The protein shells of MCPs are thought to selectively control the movement of enzyme cofactors, substrates, and products (including toxic or volatile intermediates) between the MCP interior and the cytoplasm of the cell using both passive electrostatic/steric and dynamic gated mechanisms. Evidence suggests that specialized shell proteins conduct electrons between the cytoplasm and the lumen of the MCP and/or help rebuild damaged iron-sulfur centers in the encapsulated enzymes. The MCP shell is elaborated through a family of small proteins whose structural core is known as a bacterial microcompartment (BMC) domain. BMC domain proteins oligomerize into flat, hexagonally shaped tiles, which assemble into extended protein sheets that form the facets of the shell. Shape complementarity along the edges allows different types of BMC domain proteins to form mixed sheets, while sequence variation provides functional diversification. Recent studies have also revealed targeting sequences that mediate protein encapsulation within MCPs, scaffolding proteins that organize lumen enzymes and the use of private cofactor pools (NAD/H and coenzyme A [HS-CoA]) to facilitate cofactor homeostasis. Although much remains to be learned, our growing understanding of MCPs is providing a basis for bioengineering of protein-based containers for the production of chemicals/pharmaceuticals and for use as molecular delivery vehicles.},

A well-recognized conceptual insight is provided by a general mathematical relation, Hamilton's rule. This rule can in principle be invoked to explain natural examples of cooperation, but measuring the variables that it involves is a particularly challenging problem and controlling these variables experimentally an even more daunting task. Here, we overcome these difficulties by using a simple synthetic microbial system of producers and nonproducers of an extracellular growth-enhancing molecule, which acts as a 'common good.' For this system, we are able to manipulate the intrinsic growth difference between producers and nonproducers, as well as the impact of the common good on the growth rate of its recipients. Our synthetic system is thus uniquely suited for studying the relation between the parameters entering Hamilton's rule and the quantities governing the systems' behavior. The experimental results highlight a crucial effect of nonlinearities in the response to the common good, which in general tend to limit the predictive value of Hamilton's rule.},

Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved.

Cells are mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold 2x TSS and are immediately ready for use. Genetic transformation is equally simple: plasmid DNA is added and the cells are incubated for 5-60 min at 4°C. A heat pulse is not necessary and the incubation time at 4°C is not crucial, so there are no critical timing steps in the transformation procedure. Transformed bacteria are grown and selected by standard methods. Thus, this procedure eliminates the centrifugation, washing, and long-term incubation steps of current methods. Although cells taken early in the growth cycle (OD600 0.3-0.4) yield the highest transformation efficiencies (107-108 transformants per μg of plasmid DNA), cells harvested at other stages in the growth cycle (including stationary phase) are capable of undergoing transformation (105-107 transformants per μg of DNA). For long-term storage of competent cells, bacteria can be frozen in TSS without addition of other components. Our procedure represents a simple and convenient method for the preparation, transformation, and storage of competent bacterial cells.},

The protocol developed for the preparation of competent E. coli was designed to be rapid, convenient, and inexpensive, yet suitable to achieve transformation efficiencies sufficient for routine cloning experiments. Although transformation efficiencies obtained with the protocol are comparable to those of other commonly used methods to prepare competent bacteria, the technique is advantageous in that it is simple and can be completed in a short time once the bacteria are grown. Although the conditions necessary to achieve maximum numbers of transformants are specified, there is flexibility in the assay. © 1993},

  abstract = {Capture and conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals is intended to answer global challenges on environmental issues, climate change and energy security. Engineered cyanobacteria have been enabled to produce industry-relevant chemicals from CO2. However, the final products from cyanobacteria have often been mixed with fermented metabolites during dark fermentation. In this study, our engineering of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 enabled continuous conversion of CO2 to volatile acetone as sole product. This process occurred during lighted, aerobic culture via both ATP-driven malonyl-CoA synthesis pathway and heterologous phosphoketolase (PHK)-phosphotransacetylase (Pta) pathway. Because of strong correlations between the metabolic pathways of acetate and acetone, supplying the acetyl-CoA directly from CO2 in the engineered strain, led to sole production of acetone (22.48~mg/L~±~1.00) without changing nutritional constraints, and without an anaerobic shift. Our engineered S.~elongatus strains, designed for acetone production, could be modified to create biosolar cell factories for sustainable photosynthetic production of acetyl-CoA-derived biochemicals.},

A membrane bioreactor in pilot scale was operated at different solid retention times (SRTs) and the results obtained are compared to conventional activated sludge plants (CASP) operated at different SRTs. The SRT is an important design parameter and its impact on achievable treatment efficiencies was evaluated. Different behaviours were observed for the different investigated compounds. Some compounds as the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were not removed in any of the sampled treatment facilities and effluent concentrations in the range of influent concentrations were measured. Other compounds as bisphenol-A, the analgesic ibuprofen or the lipid regulator bezafibrate were nearly completely removed (removal rates {$>$}90\%). The operation of WWTPs with SRTs suitable for nitrogen removal (SRT{$>$}10 days at 10 degrees C) also increases the removal potential regarding selected micropollutants. No differences in treatment efficiencies were detected between the two treatment techniques. As in conventional WWTP also the removal potential of MBRs depends on the SRT. Ultrafiltration membranes do not allow any additional detention of the investigated substances due to size exclusion. However, MBRs achieve a high SRT within a compact reactor. Nonylphenolpolyehtoxylates were removed in higher extend in very low-loaded conventional WWTPs, due to variations of redox conditions, necessary for the degradation of those compounds.},

Significant changes in extracorporeal membranes have occurred over the past five decades in which hemodialysis (HD) has been available as a therapy for both acute renal failure (ARF) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For cellulosic membranes, these changes have included a reduction in thickness, hydroxyl group substitution, and an increase in pore size. These modifications have resulted in enhanced efficiency of small solute removal, a broader spectrum of overall solute removal, and an attenuation of complement activation in comparison to the thick, unsubstituted cellulosic membranes of low permeability used in the early days of HD therapy. Synthetic membranes, originally developed specifically for use in high-flux HD and hemofiltration, have also evolved during this same time period. In fact, the initially clear distinction between low-flux regenerated cellulosic and high-flux synthetic membranes has become blurred, as membrane formulators have developed products designed to appeal to enthusiasts for both membrane formats. The purpose of this review is to characterize both the solute removal and biocompatibility characteristics of dialysis membranes according to their composition (that is, polymeric makeup) and structure. In this regard, the manner in which membrane biocompatibility interacts with flux is highlighted.},

In plant chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, the essential constitutive Clp protease consists of the Hsp100/ClpC chaperone partnering a proteolytic core of catalytic ClpP and noncatalytic ClpR subunits. In the present study, we have examined putative determinants conferring the highly specific association between ClpC and the ClpP3/R core from the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. Two conserved sequences in the N-terminus of ClpR (tyrosine and proline motifs) and one in the N-terminus of ClpP3 (MPIG motif) were identified as being crucial for the ClpC-ClpP3/R association. These N-terminal domains also influence the stability of the ClpP3/R core complex itself. A unique C-terminal sequence was also found in plant and cyanobacterial ClpC orthologues just downstream of the P-loop region previously shown in Escherichia coli to be important for Hsp100 association to ClpP. This R motif in Synechococcus ClpC confers specificity for the ClpP3/R core and prevents association with E. coli ClpP; its removal from ClpC reverses this core specificity.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graph-ical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

A growing body of literature demonstrates the involvement of regulated death programs in the abrupt collapse of phytoplankton populations, and particularly implicates processes that exhibit characteristics of metazoan programmed cell death. Here, we report that the cell-free, extracellular fluid (conditioned medium) of a collapsing aged culture of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is toxic to exponentially growing cells of this cyanobacterium, as well as to a large variety of photosynthetic organisms, but not to eubacteria. The toxic effect, which is light-dependent, involves oxidative stress, as suggested by damage alleviation by antioxidants, and the very high sensitivity of a catalase-mutant to the conditioned medium. At relatively high cell densities, S. elongatus cells survived the deleterious effect of conditioned medium in a process that required de novo protein synthesis. Application of conditioned medium from a collapsing culture caused severe pigment bleaching not only in S. elongatus cells, but also resulted in bleaching of pigments in a cell free extract. The latter observation indicates that the elicited damage is a direct effect that does not require an intact cell, and therefore, is mechanistically different from the metazoan-like programmed cell death described for phytoplankton. We suggest that S. elongatus in aged cultures are triggered to produce a toxic compound, and thus, this process may be envisaged as a novel regulated death program. © 2014 Cohen et al.},

The Kai-based oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro, demonstrating that the clock can run without protein synthesis and degradation; however, protein degradation is known to be important for clock function in vivo. Here, we report that strains deficient in the ClpXP1P2 protease have, in addition to known long-period circadian rhythms, an exaggerated ability to synchronize with the external environment (reduced "jetlag") compared with WT strains. Deletion of the ClpX chaperone, but not the protease subunits ClpP1 or ClpP2, results in cell division defects in a manner that is dependent on the expression of a dusk-peaking factor. We propose that chaperone activities of ClpX are required to coordinate clock control of cell division whereas the protease activities of the ClpXP1P2 complex are required to maintain appropriate periodicity of the clock and its synchronization with the external environment.},

But the large difference in length scales between these microscopic/nanoscopic jets and the macroscopic drops and films from which they emerge has made it difficult to model the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) processes that govern such phenomena. Here, we report simulations and experiments that enable a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms of cone formation, jet emission and break-up that occur during EHD tip streaming from a liquid film of finite conductivity. Simulations show that EHD tip streaming does not occur if the liquid is perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating, and enable us to develop a scaling law to predict the size of the drops produced from jet break-up.},

  abstract = {Bacteria communicate via short-range physical and chemical signals, interactions known to mediate quorum sensing, sporulation, and other adaptive phenotypes. Although most in vitro studies examine bacterial properties averaged over large populations, the levels of key molecular determinants of bacterial fitness and pathogenicity (e.g., oxygen, quorum-sensing signals) may vary over micrometer scales within small, dense cellular aggregates believed to play key roles in disease transmission. A detailed understanding of how cell-cell interactions contribute to pathogenicity in natural, complex environments will require a new level of control in constructing more relevant cellular models for assessing bacterial phenotypes. Here, we describe a microscopic three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy that enables multiple populations of bacteria to be organized within essentially any 3D geometry, including adjacent, nested, and free-floating colonies. In this laser-based lithographic technique, microscopic containers are formed around selected bacteria suspended in gelatin via focal cross-linking of polypeptide molecules. After excess reagent is removed, trapped bacteria are localized within sealed cavities formed by the cross-linked gelatin, a highly porous material that supports rapid growth of fully enclosed cellular populations and readily transmits numerous biologically active species, including polypeptides, antibiotics, and quorum-sensing signals. Using this approach, we show that a picoliter-volume aggregate of Staphylococcus aureus can display substantial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by enclosure within a shell composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},

  abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Of particular concern are Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria, which recently emerged as global pathogens, with nosocomial mortality rates reaching 19–54\% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013; Joly Guillou, 2005; Talbot et al., 2006). Acinetobacter gains antibiotic resistance remarkably rapidly (Antunes et al., 2014; Joly Guillou, 2005), with multi drug-resistance (MDR) rates exceeding 60\% (Antunes et al., 2014; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). Despite growing concern (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013; Talbot et al., 2006), the mechanisms underlying this extensive HGT remain poorly understood (Adams et al., 2008; Fournier et al., 2006; Imperi et al., 2011; Ramirez et al., 2010; Wilharm et al., 2013). Here, we show bacterial predation by Acinetobacter baylyi increases cross-species HGT by orders of magnitude, and we observe predator cells functionally acquiring adaptive resistance genes from adjacent prey. We then develop a population-dynamic model quantifying killing and HGT on solid surfaces. We show DNA released via cell lysis is readily available for HGT and may be partially protected from the environment, describe the effects of cell density, and evaluate potential environmental inhibitors. These findings establish a framework for understanding, quantifying, and combating HGT within the microbiome and the emergence of MDR super-bugs.Every year, antibiotics save millions of lives, but this may not last forever. The bacteria that cause infections are getting smarter and continuously evolve genes to become resistant to antibiotics, which makes it harder to kill them. In many cases, using stronger drugs can bypass this problem, but some 'super-bugs' are developing resistance to every drug we have. For example, the bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii has recently been classified as a global threat that kills thousands of people every year, which placed it on a top six 'most wanted' list for multi drug-resistant bacteria. Worryingly, this drug resistance seems to develop faster than 'standard' evolution would allow, making it difficult to keep up with developing new effective drugs.One way bacteria can shortcut the evolution of resistance is through a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which they collect resistance genes from other bacteria. Some bacteria can speed up this gene transfer by actively killing their neighbors to extract their DNA. However, until now, this process has not been observed directly, and it was not fully understood where and when killing neighbors becomes important for gene transfer.Now, Cooper, Tsimring and Hasty have studied a relative of A. baumannii called A. baylyi. Together with another type of bacteria that contained green fluorescence genes, A. baylyi was placed onto a surface that allowed both species to grow. As the two types of bacteria grew together, A. baylyi started to kill the other one and stole their genes. This happened so often that some started to become fluorescent, which could be observed in real time under a microscope. A. baylyi also stole genes for antibiotic resistance, and when an antibiotic was added, the bacteria with the stolen resistance genes kept growing and dividing, while the others were killed.Cooper et al. then developed a mathematical model to quantify and simulate this killing-enhanced horizontal gene transfer. The results showed that killing other bacteria made gene transfer more effective when the number of A. baylyi was high and the number of 'victims' was low – and also when they were together for a shorter period.This work may help to explain how Acinetobacter and similar bacteria develop drug resistance so quickly. A next step will be to measure and compare gene transfer parameters in different types of bacteria. A better understanding of how, where, and when gene transfer happens, may in the future help to guide strategies to fight resistance.},

Transcription activatorâ 'like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial virulence factors that have recently gained traction in biotechnology applications owing to their customizable DNA-binding specificity. In this work we expanded the versatility of these transcription factors to create an inducible TALE system by inserting tobacco-etch virus (TEV) protease recognition sites into the TALE backbone. The resulting engineered TALEs maintain transcriptional repression of their target genes in Escherichia coli, but are degraded after induction of the TEV protease, thereby promoting expression of the previously repressed target gene of interest. This TALE-TEV technology enables both repression and induction of plasmid or chromosomal target genes in a manner analogous to traditional repressor proteins but with the added flexibility of being operator-agnostic.},

Conversely, organisms that antagonize each other will tend to spatially segregate, creating distinct micro-communities and increased diversity at larger length scales. We argue that, in order to understand the role that biological interactions play in microbial community function, it is necessary to study microscale spatial organization with enough throughput to measure statistical associations between taxa and possible alternative community states. We conclude by proposing strategies to tackle this challenge.},

Here we describe the development of a biosensing technique in which the conductance of a population of molecular ion channels is switched by the recognition event. The approach mimics biological sensory functions and can be used with most types of receptor, including antibodies and nucleotides. The technique is very flexible and even in its simplest form it is sensitive to picomolar concentrations of proteins. The sensor is essentially an impedance element whose dimensions can readily be reduced to become an integral component of a microelectronic circuit. It may be used in a wide range of applications and in complex media, including blood. These uses might include cell typing, the detection of large proteins, viruses, antibodies, DNA, electrolytes, drugs, pesticides and other low-molecular-weight compounds.},

We demonstrate the ability to control solute-scaffold effective diffusivity as a function of solute molecular weight and hydrogel concentration. Within cell laden microfluidic hydrogels, we demonstrate increased cellular viability in perfused hydrogel systems compared to static controls. We observed a significant increase in cell viability at all time points greater than zero at distances up to 1 mm from the perfused channel.

Thus, significant effort has been directed toward tuning their size, composition, morphology, and functionality to further their application.

Under conditions where analyte-wall interactions (adsorption) are minimized, e.g. in a 50/50 (v/v) methanol/aqueous buffer, the stopped flow (2.71 ± 0.09 × 10-6 cm2 s-1), E-field (2.684 ±0.005 × 10-6 cm2 s - 1) and the static imaging (2.69 ± 0.02 × 10-6 cm2 s - 1) measurements were all within experimental error of one another and previously reported values. Under 100\% aqueous conditions, however, the diffusion coefficient measured dynamically was 11\% larger than that measured statically. Diffusion coefficients for rhodamine B, fluorescein, 2′,7′dichloro-fluorescein (DCF), rhodamine 6G, tetramethylrhodamine labeled glutamic acid and isoleucine, and fluorescein conjugated bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin were also measured using the static imaging method. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Background: Multiplexed in-situ fluorescent imaging offers several advantages over single-cell assays that do not preserve the spatial characteristics of biological samples. This spatial information, in addition to morphological properties and extensive intracellular or surface marker profiling, comprise promising avenues for rapid advancements in the understanding of disease progression and diagnosis. As protocols for conducting such imaging experiments continue to improve, it is the intent of this study to provide and validate software for processing the large quantity of associated data in kind. Results: Cytokit offers (i) an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated image processing pipeline; (ii) efficient input/output (I/O) strategies for operations specific to high dimensional microscopy; and (iii) an interactive user interface for cross filtering of spatial, graphical, expression, and morphological cell properties within the 100+ GB image datasets common to multiplexed immunofluorescence. Image processing operations supported in Cytokit are generally sourced from existing deep learning models or are at least in part adapted from open source packages to run in a single or multi-GPU environment. The efficacy of these operations is demonstrated through several imaging experiments that pair Cytokit results with those from an independent but comparable assay. A further validation also demonstrates that previously published results can be reproduced from a publicly available multiplexed image dataset. Conclusion: Cytokit is a collection of open source tools for quantifying and analyzing properties of individual cells in large fluorescent microscopy datasets that are often, but not necessarily, generated from multiplexed antibody labeling protocols over many fields of view or time periods. This project is best suited to bioinformaticians or other technical users that wish to analyze such data in a batch-oriented, high-throughput setting.

Chemotaxonomic and physiological properties of strain DX3-12(T) supported its affiliation to the genus Planomicrobium. Strain DX3-12(T) and Planomicrobium mcmeekinii exhibited common phenotypic properties such as the ability to reduce nitrate, but they could be distinguished from each other by physiological and biochemical tests, e.g. acid production from glucose, growth temperature and NaCl concentration requirements. DNA-DNA hybridization further distinguished strain DX3-12(T) from Planomicrobium mcmeekinii at the species level. Therefore, it is proposed that strain DX3-12(T) (=AS 1.3454(T)=JCM 12466(T)) represents a novel species, Planomicrobium chinense sp. nov.

Recently, cell shape determining proteins of the MreB family were shown to form helical, actin-like cables in the cell. We used a fluorescent derivative of the antibiotic vancomycin as a probe for nascent peptidoglycan synthesis in unfixed cells of various Gram-positive bacteria. In the rod-shaped bacterium B. subtilis, synthesis of the cylindrical part of the cell wall occurs in a helical pattern governed by an MreB homolog, Mbl. However, a few rod-shaped bacteria have no MreB system. Here, a rod-like shape can be achieved by a completely different mechanism based on use of polar growth zones derived from the division machinery. These results provide insights into the diverse molecular strategies used by bacteria to control their cellular morphology, as well as suggesting ways in which these strategies may impact on growth rates and cell envelope structure.},

Digital logic has been used to build small-scale circuits, but other frameworks may be needed for efficient computation in the resource-limited environments of cells. Here we demonstrate that synthetic analog gene circuits can be engineered to execute sophisticated computational functions in living cells using just three transcription factors. Such synthetic analog gene circuits exploit feedback to implement logarithmically linear sensing, addition, ratiometric and power-law computations. The circuits exhibit Weber's law behaviour as in natural biological systems, operate over a wide dynamic range of up to four orders of magnitude and can be designed to have tunable transfer functions. Our circuits can be composed to implement higher-order functions that are well described by both intricate biochemical models and simple mathematical functions. By exploiting analog building-block functions that are already naturally present in cells, this approach efficiently implements arithmetic operations and complex functions in the logarithmic domain. Such circuits may lead to new applications for synthetic biology and biotechnology that require complex computations with limited parts, need wide-dynamic-range biosensing or would benefit from the fine control of gene expression.},

Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.},

The underlying assumption made to explain QS is that the secretion of these extracellular factors is more beneficial at higher cell densities. However, this fundamental assumption has never been tested experimentally. Here, we directly test this by independently manipulating population density and the induction and response to the QS signal, using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model organism. We found that the benefit of QS was relatively greater at higher population densities, and that this was because of more efficient use of QS-dependent extracellular "public goods." In contrast, the benefit of producing "private goods," which are retained within the cell, does not vary with cell density. Overall, these results support the idea that QS is used to coordinate the switching on of social behaviors at high densities when such behaviors are more efficient and will provide the greatest benefit.},

This can lead to the emergence of unwanted coupling between the expression of different circuit genes, complicating the design process and potentially leading to circuit failure. By expressing a synthetic 16S rRNA with altered specificity, we can partition the ribosome pool into host-specific and circuit-specific activities. We show mathematically and experimentally that the effects of resource competition can be alleviated by targeting genes to different ribosomal pools. This division of labour can be used to increase flux through a metabolic pathway. We develop a model of cell physiology which is able to capture these observations and use it to design a dynamic resource allocation controller. When implemented, this controller acts to decouple genes by increasing orthogonal ribosome production as the demand for translational resources by a synthetic circuit increases.},

At least two parameters were found to be very important for many applications: the presence of air on superhydrophobic materials with self-cleaning properties (Cassie-Baxter state) and the robustness of the superhydrophobic properties (stability of the Cassie-Baxter state).

  abstract = {Bacterial genomes are remarkably stable from one generation to the next but are plastic on an evolutionary time scale, substantially shaped by horizontal gene transfer, genome rearrangement, and the activities of mobile DNA elements. This implies the existence of a delicate balance between the maintenance of genome stability and the tolerance of genome instability. In this review, we describe the specialized genetic elements and the endogenous processes that contribute to genome instability. We then discuss the consequences of genome instability at the physiological level, where cells have harnessed instability to mediate phase and antigenic variation, and at the evolutionary level, where horizontal gene transfer has played an important role. Indeed, this ability to share DNA sequences has played a major part in the evolution of life on Earth. The evolutionary plasticity of bacterial genomes, coupled with the vast numbers of bacteria on the planet, substantially limits our ability to control disease.},

The biochemical mechanisms responsible for this process are poorly understood. In bacteria, the ftsZ gene product, FtsZ, is required for cell division1-3,17, playing a prominent role in cytokinesis. The cellular concentration of FtsZ regulates the frequency of division4 and genetic studies have indicated that it is the target of several endogenous division inhibitors5. At the time of onset of septal invagination, the FtsZ protein is recruited from the cytoplasm to the division site, where it assembles into a ring that remains associated with the leading edge of the invaginating septum until septation is completed6. Here we report that FtsZ specifically binds and hydrolyses GTP. The reaction can be dissociated into a GTP-dependent activation stage that is markedly affected by the concentration of FtsZ, and a hydrolysis stage in which GTP is hydrolysed to GDP. The results indicate that GTP binding and hydrolysis are important in enabling FtsZ to support bacterial cytokinesis, either by facilitating the assembly of the FtsZ ring and/or by catalysing an essential step in the cytokinetic process itself. © 1992 Nature Publishing Group.},

We found that only di- and trisaccharides could fully diffuse into the periplasm, whereas higher-molecular-weight saccharides were nonpenetrable. In addition, low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycols rapidly diffused across the cell wall. Kinetics experiments also showed that both sucrose and raffinose in the periplasm exchanged rapidly with sugars in the medium, even at 0 degrees C. These results suggest that the cell wall acts as a molecular sieve, with an exclusion limit near 550 to 650 daltons for saccharides.

When a solid substrate with a positively charged planar surface is immersed in the solution containing the negatively charged bipolar amphiphile, a monolayer of the amphiphile is adsorbed and due to its bipolar structure the surface charge is reversed. After rinsing in pure water the substrate is immersed in the solution containing the positively charged bipolar amphiphile. Again a monolayer is adsorbed but now the original surface charge is restored. By repeating both steps in a cyclic fashion alternating multilayer assemblies of both compounds are obtained.

  abstract = {Large oil spills caused by tanker accidents, such as those of the Exxon Valdez (Alaska, USA, 1989), the Erika (Bay of Biscay, France, 1999) or the Prestige (Galicia, Spain, 2003), represent but a tiny fraction of the 1.3 million tons of petroleum that are released into the oceans every year through accidental or deliberate discharge from tankers and processing sites. That the oceans retain a generally pleasant appearance—rather than becoming a global sticky goo—reflects the ceaseless activity of marine bacteria that maintain such environmental insults in check1. In this issue, Schneiker et al.2 report the first genome sequence of a marine hydrocarbonoclastic (from the Greek klastes, the one who breaks) bacterium, Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2. The sequence provides a foundation for understanding how this microorganism devours oil components in the ocean and for developing improved bioremediation strategies.Whenever an oil spill afflicts an environmentally sensitive area, the governments of the affected countries turn in panic to the scientific community in search of a quick solution. In the public imagination, such solutions often take the form of a superbug able to quickly consume vast quantities of petroleum.The 1989 Exxon Valdez episode off the Alaskan coastline was the first instance in which bacterial large-scale bioremediation was attempted3. Several years later4, it became clear that directed inoculation of the contaminated sites with hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria precultured in the laboratory accounted for very little petroleum removal. In addition, none of the attempts to use genetically engineered microorganisms to remove oil in natural settings has so far succeeded5. In contrast, addition of lipophilic fertilizers aimed at improving the carbon/phosphorus/nitrogen balance of the nutrient mix for indigenous marine oil-degrading bacteria did make a difference3.Nevertheless, the idea of an oil-degrading superbug is alive and well. What's more, bacterial cocktails of undisclosed composition and uncertain effects, such as Putidoil, Devoroil, Oleovorin or Destroil ({$<$}http://owwz.de/uploads/media/Umweltbiotechnologie.pdf{$>$}), are still used on petroleum spills as a sort of homeopathic remedy.What are the alternatives for dealing with oil spills? There is clearly an ongoing shift from genetic engineering of biocatalysts for in situ delivery—a popular option in the late 1980s—towards eco-engineering aimed at activating a desired metabolic activity in the indigenous bacterial community. Biological degradation of oil along seacoasts by marine microorganisms, especially of the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, has been documented for nearly a century. Many bacteria growing on petroleum components have also been isolated and characterized in the laboratory1. However, it was only in 2002 that a link between the removal of hydrocarbons in fertilized, oil-contaminated seawater and the blooming of a specific genus of bacteria called Alcanivorax was firmly established6. Specimens of these microbes were first isolated in the late 1990s during screenings for biosurfactant-producing, n-alkane-degrading bacteria7, 8 near the Island of Borkum in the North Sea.The most interesting aspect of this aerobic Gram-negative -proteobacterium is not that it degrades hydrocarbons—many marine and other bacteria do this1—, but that it lives exclusively on alkanes, rejecting other staple carbon sources like sugars and amino acids. Furthermore, A. borkumensis also does not consume other hydrocarbons, such as the light aromatic fractions, that many environmental bacteria are able to metabolize. This, combined with their repertoire of diverse alkane hydroxylases9, which degrade branched alkanes very efficiently10, make Alcanivorax bacteria major players in the spontaneous biological cleanup of oil-contaminated environments1, 6. These characteristics have rapidly positioned Alcanivorax as the hydrocarbonoclastic microorganism of reference for further exploration of bioremediation as a practical oil-removal technology.Given the lifestyle and known nutritional habits of Alcanivorax, the fact that the A. borkumensis SK2 genome encodes several systems for degrading non-aromatic hydrocarbons is not a surprise. What is surprising is the richness of auxiliary functions that further expand an already optimized enzymatic battery for metabolism of alkanes. These include rhl-like genes for the production of oil emulsifiers as well as enzymes for the synthesis of alginate and other exopolymers. The latter, together with type IV pili, are likely to aid the formation of biofilms on oil droplets.Other features include a range of systems for capturing small amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and various oligo-elements in the generally nutrient-poor marine medium. Finally, the genome includes activities for survival in the high salt and high UV radiation of the upper layer of the aerobic ocean surface, and encodes many chaperones and related functions. The bacterium's lack of interest in sugars is reflected in the absence of any sugar-trafficking protein related to the phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system. However, the genome does contain a complete set of these proteins (PtsP, PtsN, PtsO) that is involved in the overall regulation of carbon/nitrogen balance in the cells. The key molecular elements involved in petroleum degradation and adaptation to the harsh environment of an oil slick are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1. Some of the mechanisms for oil degradation and survival encoded by the A. borkumensis SK2 genome. Both crude petroleum and refined oil contain a complex mixture of organic molecules, including a considerable fraction of linear, cyclic and branched aliphatic hydrocarbons. During oil spills, the various components are deposited on shorelines, sink in the seabed or remain in suspension in seawater. The niches for Alcanivorax borkumensis are probably located at the aerobic, alkane-rich areas of shorelines and the oxygen-rich layers of the oil-polluted sea surface. However, A. borkumensis cannot tackle contaminated anaerobic sediments, aromatic hydrocarbons or the heavier oil fractions.  Based on the sequence reported by Schneiker et al., one could argue that the key to improving oil biodegradation in situ is to focus on the nutritional well-being of indigenous marine bacteria by careful manipulation of the carbon/nitrogen/phosphorous balance and by alleviating site-specific environmental hardships. This simple notion—which may signify the demise of the concept of an 'engineered superbug'—may guide better bioremediation strategies in the future. However, the potential biotechnological applications of information mined from this genome are by no means limited to oil degradation. For instance, the modeling of carbon fluxes versus those of nitrogen and phosphorus through a virtual metabolic network based on the genome sequence may allow the discovery of conditions in which the excess carbon available in oil is not directly translated into bacterial biomass. In fact, the optimal environmental agent would be the one that expresses a maximum of catalytic activity with a minimum buildup of biomass. Carbon overflow could, for instance, be rationally diverted to the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (that is, bioplastics), an activity for which A. borkumensis SK2 seems to be genetically well endowed2. Having the genome and the metabolic model in hand paves the way to optimize such C-conversion processes, even in the open sea. A second exciting area of further study is the analysis of the transcriptional regulatory network of these bacteria in situ. Given the reduced number of external nutrients that A. borkumensis SK2 uses, it is likely that most of the regulatory processes are related to global balancing of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the context of enduring environmental stresses, rather than to a response to specific small signal molecules. This is good news for biotech applications in the ocean in general, as it suggests that attention to the nutritional makeup of a target site, rather than the addition of particular inducers, may go a long way in enhancing the bioremediation capabilities of these environments. 1.

Even subtle changes of the composition of acyl chains or head groups can alter the packing arrangements of lipids within the bilayer. This changes the balance between bilayer and nonbilayer lipids, serving to affect bilayer stability and fluidity, as well as altering lipid-protein interactions. External factors can also change membrane fluidity and lipid composition; including temperature, chemicals, ions, pressure, nutrients and the growth phase of the microbial culture. Various biophysical techniques have been used to monitor fluidity changes within the bacterial membrane. In this review, bacterial cytoplasmic membrane changes and related functional effects will be examined as well as the use of fluorescence polarization methods and examples of data obtained from research with bacteria. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {FtsZ filaments participate in bacterial cell division, but it is still not clear how their dynamic polymerization and shape exert force on the underlying membrane. We present a theoretical description of individual filaments that incorporates information from molecular dynamic simulations. The structure of the crystallized Methanococcus jannaschii FtsZ dimer was used to model a FtsZ pentamer that showed a curvature and a twist. The estimated bending and torsion angles between monomers and their fluctuations were included in the theoretical description. The MD data also permitted positioning the curvature with respect to the protein coordinates and allowed us to explore the effect of the relative orientation of the preferred curvature with respect to the surface plane. We find that maximum tension is attained when filaments are firmly attached and oriented with their curvature perpendicular to the surface and that the twist serves as a valve to release or to tighten the tension exerted by the curved filaments on the membrane. The theoretical model also shows that the presence of torsion can explain the shape distribution of short filaments observed by Atomic Force Microscopy in previously published experiments. New experiments with FtsZ covalently attached to lipid membranes show that the filament on-plane curvature depends on lipid head charge, confirming the predicted monomer orientation effects. This new model underlines the fact that the combination of the three elements, filament curvature, twist and the strength and orientation of its surface attachment, can modulate the force exerted on the membrane during cell division.},

We immobilized Escherichia coli BL21 transformants containing different expression plasmids. One contained DNA coding for a T-cell receptor beta chain, which was expressed as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. The other two encoded bacterial superantigens Staphylococcal Enterotoxin G and Streptococcal Superantigen, which were expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm. The properties of immobilization and storage stability in inorganic matrices prepared from two precursors, silicon dioxide and tetraethoxysilane, were studied. Immobilized E. coli was stored in sealed tubes at 4 and 20 degrees C and the number of viable cells and level of recombinant protein production were analyzed weekly. Different tests showed that the biochemical characteristics of immobilized E. coli remained intact. At both temperatures selected, we found that the number of bacteria in silicon dioxide-derived matrix was of the same order of magnitude (10(9) cfu ml(-1)) as before immobilization, for 2 months. After 2 weeks, cells immobilized in an alkoxide-derived matrix decreased to 10(4) cfu ml(-1) at 4 degrees C, and no viable cells were detected at 20 degrees C. We found that immobilized bacteria could be used as a starter to produce recombinant proteins with yields comparable to those obtained from glycerol stocks: 15 mg l(-1) for superantigens and 2 mg l(-1) for T-cell receptor beta chain. These results contribute to the development of methods for microbial cell preservation under field conditions.},

Enzyme engineering has been mainly applied to improve lipases catalytic properties, mostly based on classical protein engineering or more advanced directed evolution. Lipases can be found in a broad range of organisms, including plants and animals, however, it is chiefly the microbial lipases that find immense application. New frontiers in the engineering of lipases and other biocatalysts can be envisioned by the usage of an expanded genetic code, which, in theory, can provide an unlimited set of synthetic noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) with new chemical functionalities; ncAAs have potential advantages in biocatalysis. Two approaches, which have been extensively used for the improvement of lipase activity, has been the application of immobilization, and bioorthogonal transformation techniques. The chapter also presents a case study on manipulation of proline, phenylalanine, and methionine residues in lipase.},

Bead formation is based on crosslinking of an alginate biopolymer and mineralisation of silicic acid in combination with a coacervation process between a polycation and the silica sol, forming a semi-permeable external membrane. The excellent mechanical strength and durability of the monodispersed beads and the control of their porosity and textural properties is achieved by tailoring the silica and alginate loading, polycation concentration and incubation time during coacervation. This process has led to the formation of a remarkably robust hybrid material that confers exceptional protection to live cells against sheer stresses and contamination in a diverse range of applications. Dunaliella tertiolecta encapsulated within this hybrid core-shell system display high photosynthetic activity over a long duration ({$>$}1year). This sustainable biotechnology could find use in high value chemical harvests and biofuel cells to photosynthetic solar cells (energy transformation, electricity production, water splitting technologies). Furthermore the material can be engineered into various forms from spheres to variable thickness films, broadening its potential applications.},

  abstract = {Bioencapsulation involves the envelopment of tissues or biological active substances in semipermeable membranes. Bioencapsulation has been shown to be efficacious in mimicking the cell's natural environment and thereby improves the efficiency of production of different metabolites and therapeutic agents. The field of application is broad. It is being applied in bioindustry and biomedicine. It is clinically applied for the treatment of a wide variety of endocrine diseases. During the past decades many procedures to fabricate capsules have been described. Unfortunately, most of these procedures lack an adequate documentation of the characterization of the biocapsules. As a result many procedures show an extreme lab-to-lab variation and many results cannot be adequately reproduced. The characterization of capsules can no longer be neglected, especially since new clinical trials with bioencapsulated therapeutic cells have been initiated and the industrial application of bioencapsulation is growing. In the present review we discuss novel Approached to produce and characterize biocapsules in view of clinical and industrial application. A dominant factor in bioencapsulation is selection and characterization of suitable polymers. We present the adequacy of using high-resolution NMR for characterizing polymers. These polymers are applied for producing semipermeable membranes. We present the pitfalls of the currently applied methods and provide recommendations for standardization to avoid lab-to-lab variations. Also, we compare and present methodologies to produce biocompatible biocapsules for specific fields of applications and we demonstrate how physico-chemical technologies such as FT-IR, XPS, and TOF-SIMS contribute to reproducibility and standardization of the bioencapsulation process. During recent years it has become more and more clear that bioencapsulation requires a multidisciplinary approach in which biomedical, physical, and chemical technologies are combined. For adequate reproducibility and for understanding variations in outcome of biocapsules it is advisable if not mandatory to include the characterization processes presented in this review in future studies.},

These static drop arrays enabled simultaneous monitoring of growth of single as well as multiple cells encapsulated in individual droplets. To monitor the growth, individual drop volumes were kept nearly intact for more than a month by controlling the permeation of water in and out of the microfluidic device. The kinetic growth parameters were quantified by counting the increase in the number of cells in each drop over time. In addition to determining the kinetic parameters, the cell-size distribution of the microalgae was correlated with different stages of the growth. The single-cell growth kinetics of C. vulgaris showed significant heterogeneity. The specific growth rate ranged from 0.55 to 1.52 day À1 for different single cells grown in the same microfluidic device. In comparison, the specific growth rate in bulk-scale experiment was 1.12 day À1. It was found that the average cell size changes significantly at different stages of the cell growth. The mean cell-size increased from 5.99 AE 1.08 to 7.33 AE 1.3 mm from exponential to stationary growth phase. In particular, when multiple cells are grown in individual drops, we find that in the stationary growth phase, the cell size increases with the age of cell suggesting enhanced accumulation of fatty acids in older cells.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria inhabit nearly every ecosystem on earth, play a vital role in nutrient cycling, and are useful as model organisms for fundamental research in photosynthesis and carbon and nitrogen fixation. In addition, they are important for several established biotechnologies for producing food additives, nutritional and pharmaceutical compounds, and pigments, as well as emerging biotechnologies for biofuels and other products. Encapsulation of living cyanobacteria into a porous silica gel matrix is a recent approach that may dramatically improve the efficiency of certain production processes by retaining the biomass within the reactor and modifying cellular metabolism in helpful ways. Although encapsulation has been explored empirically in the last two decades for a variety of cell types, many challenges remain to achieving optimal encapsulation of cyanobacteria in silica gel. Recent evidence with Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, for example, suggests that several unknown or uncharacterized proteins are dramatically upregulated as a result of encapsulation. Also, additives commonly used to ease stresses of encapsulating living cells, such as glycerol, have detrimental impacts on photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. This mini-review is intended to address the current status of research on silica sol-gel encapsulation of cyanobacteria and research areas that may further the development of this approach for biotechnology applications.},

  abstract = {Divalent nickel (Ni(2+)), Cu(II)EDTA, methyl orange, and dichromate were used to investigate diffusion from hydrated silica sol-gel monoliths. The objective was to examine diffusion of compounds on a size regime relevant to supporting biological components encapsulated within silica gel prepared in a biologically compatible process space with no post-gelation treatments. With an initial sample set, gels prepared from tetraethoxysilane were explored in a factorial design with Ni(2+) as the tracer, varying water content during hydrolysis, acid catalyst present during hydrolysis, and the final concentration of silica. A second sample set explored diffusion of all four tracers in gels prepared with aqueous silica precursors and a variety of organically modified siloxanes. Excluding six outliers which displayed significant syneresis, the mean diffusion constant (D(gel)) across the entire process space of sample set 1 was 2.42×10(-10) m(2) s(-1); approximately 24\% of the diffusion coefficient of Ni(2+) in unconfined aqueous solution. In sample set 2, the tracer size and not gel hydrophobicity was the primary determinant of changes in diffusion rates. A strong linear inverse correlation was found between tracer size and the magnitude of D(gel). Based on correlation with the tracers used in this investigation, the characteristic 1-h diffusion distance for carbonate species relevant to supporting active phototrophic organisms was approximately 1.5mm. These results support the notion that silica sol-gel formulations may be optimized for a given biological entity of interest with manageable impact to the diffusion of small ions and molecules.},

Viability of encapsulated cells and photosynthetic activity of cells stressed by immediate (2 min) and 24-h exposure to the five stress-inducing compounds were monitored by pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry. Cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 readily survive encapsulation in both alkoxide-derived gels and gels from aqueous precursors and can remain active at least 8 weeks with slight degradation in PSII efficiency. Post-encapsulation survival was improved in gels containing no additive when compared with gels containing PEG or glycerol. Glycerol was shown to have a detrimental effect on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, reducing ϕPSII and F(v)'/F(m)' by as much as 75\%, possibly a result of disrupting excitation transfer between the phycobilisomes and photosystems. PEG was similarly deleterious, dramatically reducing the ability to carry out a state transition and adequately manage excitation energy distribution. EtOH stress also hindered state transitions, although less severely than PEG, and the cells were able to recover nearly all photosynthetic efficiency within 24 h after an initial drop. Betaine did not interfere with state transitions but did reduce quantum yield and photochemical quenching. Finally, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was shown to recover from salt stress.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Rhythmic expression patterns of kaiA and of the kaiBC operon normally peak in synchrony. In some mutants the relative timing of peaks (phase relationship) between these transcription units is altered, but circadian rhythms persist robustly. In this study, the importance of the transcriptional timing of kai genes was examined. Expressing either kaiA or kaiBC from a heterologous promoter whose peak expression occurs 12 h out of phase from the norm, and thus 12 h out of phase from the other kai locus, did not affect the time required for one cycle (period) or phase of the circadian rhythm, as measured by bioluminescence reporters. Furthermore, the data confirm that specific is elements within the promoters of the kai genes are not necessary to sustain clock function. © 2005 SGM.},

  abstract = {The effects of ethanol on the fluidity of Escherichia coli plasma membranes were examined by using a variety of fluorescent probes: 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, perylene, and a set of n-(9-anthroyloxy) fatty acids. The anthroyloxy fatty acid probes were used to examine the fluidity gradient across the width of the plasma membrane and artificial membranes prepared from lipid extracts of plasma membranes. Ethanol caused a small decrease in the polarization of probes primarily located near the membrane surface. In comparison, hexanol decreased the polarization of probes located more deeply in the membrane. Temperature had a large effect on probes located at all depths. The effects of ethanol on E. coli membranes from cells grown with or without ethanol were also examined. Plasma membranes isolated from cells grown in the presence of ethanol were more rigid than those from control cells. In contrast to plasma membranes, artificial membranes prepared from lipid extracts of ethanol-grown cells were more fluid than those from control cells. These differences are explained by analyses of membrane composition. Membranes from cells grown in the presence of ethanol are more rigid than those from control cells due to a decrease in the lipid-to-protein ratio. This change more than compensates for the fluidizing effect of ethanol and the ethanol-induced increase in membrane C18:1 fatty acid which occurs during growth. Our results suggest that the regulation of the lipid-to-protein ratio of the plasma membrane may be an important adaptive response of E. coli to growth in the presence of ethanol.\textbackslash n},

The obtained hollow films preserve both the size and shape of the templating cells. This opens a pathway for the fabrication of polymeric capsules within a wide range of size and shape by using various biological templates. They may have exciting potential applications, such as templates for nanocomposites, as containers for a large class of materials, or as cages for chemical reactions. The thickness of the films can be adjusted over a large range: from a few nm up to several tens of nm. The polymer shells are permeable to small molecules and ions but not to macromolecules. An increase in the ionic strength of the solution up to 100 mmol make the capsules permeable for proteins. Permeability and conductivity studies have provided evidence that the adsorption of lipids on polyelectrolyte layers is a means of producing capsules with controlled permeability properties. 6-Carboxyfluorescein and Rhodamin 6G were precipitated within the capsules.},

Another major cyclic cellular event, the cell cycle, is regulated by the circadian clock in the few cases where linkage of these cycles has been studied. In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, the circadian clock gates cell division by an unknown mechanism. Using timelapse microscopy, we confirm the gating of cell division in the wild-type and demonstrate the regulation of cytokinesis by key clock components. Specifically, a state of the oscillator protein KaiC that is associated with elevated ATPase activity closes the gate by acting through a known clock output pathway to inhibit FtsZ ring formation at the division site. An activity that stimulates KaiC phosphorylation independently of the KaiA protein was also uncovered. We propose a model that separates the functions of KaiC ATPase and phosphorylation in cell division gating and other circadian behaviors. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, if natural selection favors traits that confer an advantage to one individual over another, then helping others would be paradoxical. Nevertheless, cooperation persists and is critical in maintaining homeostasis in systems ranging from populations of bacteria to groupings of mammals. Developing an understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms by which cooperation operates is critical in understanding ecological and evolutionary relationships. Over the past decade, synthetic biology has emerged as a powerful tool to study social dynamics. By engineering rationally controlled and modulatable behavior into microbes, we have increased our overall understanding of how cooperation enhances, or conversely constrains, populations. Furthermore, it has increased our understanding of how cooperation is maintained within populations, which may provide a useful framework to influence populations by altering cooperation. As many bacterial pathogens require cooperation to infect the host and survive, the principles developed using synthetic biology offer promise of developing novel tools and strategies to treat infections, which may reduce the use of antimicrobial agents. Overall, the use of engineered cooperative microbes has allowed the field to verify existing, and develop novel, theories that may govern cooperative behaviors at all levels of biology.},

Moreover, sucrose-exporting cyanobacteria exhibit increased biomass production rates relative to wild-type strains, accompanied by enhanced photosystem II activity, carbon fixation, and chlorophyll content. The genetic modification of sucrose biosynthesis pathways to minimize competing glucose- or sucrose-consuming reactions can further improve sucrose production, allowing the export of sucrose at rates of up to 36.1 mg liter −1 h illumination −1 . This rate of production exceeds that of previous reports of targeted, photobiological production from microbes. Engineered S. elongatus produces sucrose in sufficient quantities (up to ∼80\% of total biomass) such that it may be a viable alternative to sugar synthesis from terrestrial plants, including sugarcane.},

  abstract = {Because cyanobacteria are photosynthetic, fast-growing microorganisms that can accumulate sucrose under salt stress, they have a potential application as a sugar source for the biomass-derived production of renewable fuels and chemicals. In the present study, the production of sucrose by the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, and Anabaena sp. PCC7120 was examined. The three species displayed different growth curves and intracellular sucrose accumulation rates in response to NaCl. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was used to examine the impact of modifying the metabolic pathway on the levels of sucrose production. The co-overexpression of sps ( slr0045). , spp ( slr0953), and ugp ( slr0207) lead to a 2-fold increase in intracellular sucrose accumulation, whereas knockout of ggpS ( sll1566) resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the production of this sugar. When combined, these genetic modifications resulted in a fourfold increase in intracellular sucrose accumulation. To explore methods for optimizing the transport of the intracellular sucrose to the growth medium, the acid-wash technique and the CscB (sucrose permease)-dependent export method were evaluated using Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Whereas the acid-wash technique proved to be effective, the CscB-dependent export method was not effective. Taken together, these results suggest that using genetic engineering, photosynthetic cyanobacteria can be optimized for efficient sucrose production. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

Implementing complex tasks in single populations can be a challenge because large genetic circuits can be burdensome and difficult to optimize. To overcome these limitations, microbial consortia can be engineered to distribute complex tasks among multiple populations. Recent studies have made substantial progress in programming microbial consortia for both basic understanding and potential applications. Microbial consortia have been designed through diverse strategies, including programming mutualistic interactions, using programmed population control to prevent overgrowth of individual populations, and spatial segregation to reduce competition. Here, we highlight the role of microbial consortia in the advances of metabolic engineering, biofilm production for engineered living materials, biocomputing, and biosensing. Additionally, we discuss the challenges for future research in microbial consortia.},

  abstract = {Biology offers the promise of a better understanding of biological systems through constructing them. Unlike naturally occurring biological systems, which are generally complicated by multiple variables and difficult to isolate components, synthetic systems can be simplified to allow for experiments that would be too difficult to interpret if done in their full natural context. Up to now, synthetic biologists have primarily focused on gene circuits, such as oscillators and switches (reviewed in ref. 1). By building synthetic genetic circuits, researchers in the field have been able to learn more about the rules of gene expression and regulation, including fundamental issues regarding noise, timing, and signal fidelity, for example. In this issue of PNAS, Shou et al. (2) demonstrate an example of a new direction for synthetic biology, what might be called synthetic ecology. Rather than using gene modules as building blocks, they mix cell populations to construct a synthetic simple obligatory cooperative ecology and use it as the basis of a model for the robustness and boundary parameters of such systems. Previous experimental and theoretical studies of cooperative or mutualistic ecologies have raised questions about the origin and stability of such systems (reviewed in ref. 3). Cooperation, by which one population or individual contributes to the survival of another at cost to itself, poses some problems. How could such a seemingly delicately balanced and evolutionarily problematic system (i) come about at all, (ii) persist through perturbations such as bottlenecks of one or both populations, and (iii. . .

  abstract = {Most of the current methods for controlling the formation rate of a key protein or enzyme in cell factories rely on the manipulation of target genes within the pathway. In this article, we present a novel synthetic system for post-translational regulation of protein levels, FENIX, which provides both independent control of the steady-state protein level and inducible accumulation of target proteins. The FENIX device is based on the constitutive, proteasome-dependent degradation of the target polypeptide by tagging with a short synthetic, hybrid NIa/SsrA amino acid sequence in the C-terminal domain. Protein production is triggered via addition of an orthogonal inducer (i.e., 3-methylbenzoate) to the culture medium. The system was benchmarked in Escherichia coli by tagging two fluorescent proteins (GFP and mCherry), and further exploited to completely uncouple poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) accumulation from bacterial growth. By tagging PhaA (3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, first step of the route), a dynamic metabolic switch at the acetyl-coenzyme A node was established in such a way that this metabolic precursor could be effectively redirected into PHB formation upon activation of the system. The engineered E. coli strain reached a very high specific rate of PHB accumulation (0.4 h-1) with a polymer content of ca. 72\% (w/w) in glucose cultures in a growth-independent mode. Thus, FENIX enables dynamic control of metabolic fluxes in bacterial cell factories by establishing post-translational synthetic switches in the pathway of interest.},

Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel scaffolds permit greater biological and biomechanical customization than do non-woven mesh scaffold technologies. However, the material characterization of PEGDA hydrogels has been predominantly limited to compression and tension, as opposed to bending. Since large flexural deformations result in points of maximum stress in native valves as well as TEHVs, it is crucial to evaluate any potential scaffold material in this mode. The effect of formulation parameters on the bending mechanics of cell-seeded PEGDA hydrogels were investigated with a custom designed bending tester. Three molecular weights (3.4, 6, and 8 kDa) and three weight fractions (5\%, 10\%, and 15\%, w/v) were subjected to three-point bending tests and the flexural stiffness was calculated. Manipulating the composition of the hydrogels resulted in flexural stiffnesses comparable with native tissues (15-220 kPa) with varied mesh sizes and swelling ratios. Hydrogels containing encapsulated valve cells, methacrylated heparin (Hep-MA), or both were substantially less stiff than acellular hydrogels. In conclusion, PEGDA hydrogels are an attractive potential scaffold system for TEHVs because they are not only cytocompatible and modifiable but can also withstand bending deformations. These studies are the first to explore the encapsulation of valvular interstitial cells in pure PEGDA hydrogels as well as to investigate the bending properties of PEGDA gels.},

The enrichment contained members of three physiological groups necessary for the syntrophic mineralization of phenol: a phenol-oxidizing bacterium, a Methanothrix-like bacterium, and an H2-utilizing methanogen. The immobilization technique resulted in the cells being embedded in a long, thin agar strand (1 mm in diameter by 2 to 50 cm in length) that resembled spaghetti. Immobilization had three effects as shown by a comparative kinetic analysis of phenol degradation by free versus immobilized cells. (i) The maximum rate of degradation was reduced from 14.8 to 10.0 μg of phenol per h; (ii) the apparent Km for the overall reaction was reduced from 90 to 46 μg of phenol per ml, probably because of the retention of acetate, H2 and CO2 in the proximity of immobilized methanogens; and (iii) the cells were protected from substrate inhibition caused by high concentrations of phenol, which increased the apparent Ki value from 900 to 1,725 μg of phenol per ml. Estimates for the kinetic parameters Km, Ki, and Vmax were used in a modified substrate inhibition model that simulated rates of phenol degradation for given phenol concentrations. The simulated rates were in close agreement with experimentally derived rates for both stimulatory and inhibitory concentrations of phenol.}

Among the developed methods of immobilization, adsorption on the surface is the most common method in bioremediation, due to the simplicity of the procedure and its non-toxicity. The choice of carrier is an essential element for successful bioremediation. It is also important to consider the type of process (in situ or ex situ), type of pollution, and properties of immobilized microorganisms.

  abstract = {The reactions involved in the bacterial metabolism of naphthalene to salicylate have been reinvestigated by using recombinant bacteria carrying genes cloned from plasmid NAH7. When intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 carrying DNA fragments encoding the first three enzymes of the pathway were incubated with naphthalene, they formed products of the dioxygenase-catalyzed ring cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. These products were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) and trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate (tHBPA). HCCA was detected as the first reaction product in these incubation mixtures by its characteristic UV spectrum, which slowly changed to a spectrum indicative of an equilibrium mixture of HCCA and tHBPA. Isomerization of either purified product occurred slowly and spontaneously to give an equilibrium mixture of essentially the same composition. tHBPA is also formed from HCCA by the action of an isomerase enzyme encoded by plasmid NAH7. The gene encoding this enzyme, nahD, was cloned on a 1.95-kb KpnI-BglII fragment. Extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 carrying this fragment catalyzed the rapid equilibration of HCCA and tHBPA. Metabolism of tHBPA to salicylaldehyde by hydration and aldol cleavage is catalyzed by a single enzyme encoded by a 1-kb MluI-StuI restriction fragment. A mechanism for the hydratase-aldolase-catalyzed reaction is proposed. The salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, nahF, was cloned on a 2.75-kb BamHI fragment which also carries the naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene, nahB. On the basis of the identification of the enzymes encoded by various clones, the gene order for the nah operon was shown to be p, A, B, F, C, E, D.},

The aim of this work was to elucidate the relationship between the molecular weight of chitosan and its antimicrobial activity upon two model microorganisms, one Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and one Gram-negative (Escherichia coli). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging was used to obtain high-resolution images of the effect of chitosans on the bacterial morphology. The AFM measurements were correlated with viable cell numbers, which show that the two species reacted differently to the high- and low-molecular-weight chitosan derivatives. The images obtained revealed not only the antibacterial effects, but also the response strategies used by the bacteria; cell wall collapse and morphological changes reflected cell death, whereas clustering of bacteria appeared to be associated with cell survival. In addition, nanoindentation experiments with the AFM revealed mechanical changes in the bacterial cell wall induced by the treatment. The nanoindentation results suggested that despite little modification observed in the Gram-positive bacteria in morphological studies, cell wall damage had indeed occurred, since cell wall stiffness was reduced after chitooligosaccharide treatment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We present an axisymmetric computational model to study the heating processes of gold nanoparticles, specifically nanorods, in aqueous medium by femtosecond laser pulses. We use a two-temperature model for the particle, a heat diffusion equation for the surrounding water to describe the heat transfer processes occurring in the system, and a thermal interface conductance to describe the coupling efficiency at the particle/water interface. We investigate the characteristic time scales of various fundamental processes, including lattice heating and thermal equilibration at the particle/surroundings interface, the effects of multiple laser pulses, and the influence of nanorod orientation relative to the beam polarization on energy absorption. Our results indicate that the thermal equilibration at the particle/water interface takes approximately 500 ps, while the electron-lattice coupling is achieved at approximately 50 ps when a 48×14 nm gold nanorod is heated to a maximum temperature of 1270 K with the application of a laser pulse having 4.70 J/m(2) average fluence. Irradiation by multiple pulses arriving at 12.5 ns time intervals (80 MHz repetition rate) causes a temperature increase of no more than 3 degrees during the first few pulses with no substantial changes during the subsequent pulses. We also analyze the degree of the nanorods' heating as a function of their orientation with respect to the polarization of the incident light. Lastly, it is shown that the temperature change of a nanorod can be modeled using its volume equivalent sphere for femtosecond laser heating within 5-15\% accuracy.},

The bacteria were activated and gradually acclimatized to high concentrations of phenol of up to 300 mg/l. The experimental results indicated that the biodegradation capabilities of P. putida are highly affected by temperature, pH, initial phenol concentration and the abundance of the biomass. The biodegradation rate is optimized at 30 degrees C, a pH of 7 and phenol concentration of 75 mg/l. Higher phenol concentrations inhibited the biomass and reduced the biodegradation rate. At high phenol concentration, the PVA particle size was found to have negligible effect on the biodegradation rate. However, for low concentrations, the biodegradation rate increased slightly with decreasing particle size. Other contaminants such heavy metals and sulfates showed no effect on the biodegradation process. Modeling of the biodegradation of phenol indicated that the Haldane inhibitory model gave better fit of the experimental data than the Monod model, which ignores the inhibitory effects of phenol.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on the conjugal transfer of DNA to Cyanobacteria. Conjugation appears to be a general means to introduce DNA from Escherichia coli into cyanobacteria, using the broad host range conjugal apparatus of an IncP plasmid, such as RP4. RP4, originally isolated from Pseudomonas, has been shown to mediate the transfer of DNA into a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including such distantly related organisms as myxobacteria, thiobacilli, and unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria. To obtain stable conjugal transfer it is necessary that (1) conjugal contact be made, (2) transferred DNA escape restriction or degradation, and (3) the DNA replicate autonomously or integrate into one of the replicons of the recipient. The first requirement is probably met in the great majority of gram-negative eubacteria, cyanobacteria included. The task for the experimenter is to find conditions that permit the last two requirements to be met as well. Even with transformable unicellular cyanobacteria, conjugation may be the preferred route of DNA transfer in certain cases. DNA taken up by unicellular cyanobacteria appears to be randomly cut early during the transformation process, so that the efficiency of transfer of a segment of nonhomologous DNA decreases exponentially with its length. © 1988, Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {AIMS: Characterization of a bacterial isolate (strain MAE2) from intertidal beach sediment capable of degrading linear and branched alkanes. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Gram-positive, aerobic, heterotrophic bacterium (strain MAE2), that was capable of extensive degradation of alkanes in crude oil but had a limited capacity for the utilization of other organic compounds, was isolated from intertidal beach sediment. MAE2 had an obligate requirement for NaCl but could not tolerate high salt concentrations. It was capable of degrading branched and n-alkanes in crude oil from C11 to C33, but was unable to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons. Comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed the isolate with members of the genus Planococcus. That finding was corroborated by chemotaxonomic and physiological data. The fatty acid composition of strain MAE2 was very similar to the type species of the genus Planococcus, P. citreus (NCIMB 1493T) and P. kocurii (NCIMB 629T), and was dominated by branched acids, mainly a15:0. However, the 16S rRNA of strain MAE2 had less than 97\% sequence identity with the type strains of P. citreus (NCIMB 1439T), P. kocurii (NCIMB 629T) and two Planococcus spp. (strain MB6-16 and strain ICO24) isolated from Antarctic sea ice. This indicated that strain MAE2 represented a separate species from these planococci. Morphologically, the isolate resembled P. okeanokoites (NCIMB 561T) and P. mcmeekinii S23F2 (ATCC 700539T). The cellular fatty acid composition of P. okeanokoites and P. mcmeekinii was considerably different from strain MAE2, and the mol \% G + C content of P. mcmeekinii was far lower than that of MAE2. CONCLUSION: On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic data, it is proposed that strain MAE2 is a new species of Planococcus, Planococcus alkanoclasticus sp. nov., for which the type strain is P. alkanoclasticus MAE2 (NCIMB 13489T). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Planococcus species are abundant members of the bacterial community in a variety of marine environments, including some in sensitive Antarctic ecosystems. The occurrence of hydrocarbon-degrading Planococcus spp. is potentially of importance in controlling the impact of hydrocarbon contamination in sensitive marine environments.},

Several bacteria that oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons to cis-dihydrodiols also oxidize indole to indigo.

Recent work has shown that purified FtsZ, in the absence of any other division proteins, can assemble Z rings when incorporated inside tubular liposomes. Moreover, these artificial Z rings can generate a constriction force, demonstrating that FtsZ is its own force generator. Here we review light microscope observations of how Z rings assemble in bacteria. Assembly begins with long-pitch helices that condense into the Z ring. Once formed, the Z ring can transition to short-pitch helices that are suggestive of its structure. FtsZ assembles in vitro into short protofilaments that are ∼30 subunits long. We present models for how these protofilaments might be further assembled into the Z ring. We discuss recent experiments on assembly dynamics of FtsZ in vitro, with particular attention to how two regulatory proteins, SulA and MinC, inhibit assembly. Recent efforts to develop antibacterial drugs that target FtsZ are reviewed. Finally, we discuss evidence of how FtsZ generates a constriction force: by protofilament bending into a curved conformation.},

Here we report the successful use of low-voltage scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM) to visualize the glycocalyx in two microbial models (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis biofilms) at high resolution, and also the dependence on fixation containing polycationic dyes for its visualization. Fixation in a paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde cocktail without cationic dyes was inadequate for visualizing the glycocalyx, whereas addition of various dyes (alcian blue, safranin, and ruthenium red) to the aldehyde cocktail appeared necessary for stabilization. The cationic dyes varied in size, shape, and charge density, and these factors appeared responsible for different phenotypic appearances of the glycocalyx with each dye.

The consequences of such environmental modifications can be detrimental or beneficial not only to the focal organism but also to other organisms sharing the same environment. Social evolution theory has been very influential in studying how social interactions mediated by public ‘goods’ or ‘bads’ evolve by emphasizing the role of spatial structure. The environmental dimensions driving these interactions, however, are typically abstracted away. We propose here a new, environment-mediated taxonomy of social behaviors where organisms are categorized by their production or consumption of environmental factors that can help or harm others in the environment.

Biofilm arrays of a range of microorganisms can be produced using this technique, including: P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, S. epidermidis, V. fischeri, E. coli, and C. albicans. This approach provides a simple, user-configurable, and relatively inexpensive method for growing biofilms in both static and flow conditions.

S-layers have important roles in growth and survival, and their many functions include the maintenance of cell integrity, enzyme display and, in pathogens and commensals, interaction with the host and its immune system.

For such applications, 2-hydroxy-1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy) phenyl]-2-methyl-1-propanone (I2959) is the most commonly used photoinitiator (by virtue of its moderate water solubility), yet this initiator has an absorption spectrum that is poorly matched with wavelengths of light generally regarded as benign to living cells, limiting the rate at which it may initiate polymerization in their presence. In contrast, acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators, generally exhibit absorption spectra at wavelengths suitable for cell encapsulation, yet commercially available initiators of this class have low water solubility. Here, a water soluble lithium acylphosphinate salt is evaluated for its ability to polymerize diacrylated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGDA) monomers rapidly into hydrogels, while maintaining high viability during direct encapsulation of cells. Through rheometric measurements, the time to reach gelation of a PEGDA solution with the phosphinate initiator is one tenth the time for that using I2959 at similar concentrations, when exposed to 365 nm light. Further, polymerization with the phosphinate initiator at 405 nm visible light exposure is achieved with low initiator concentrations and light intensities, precluded in polymerizations initiated with I2959 by its absorbance profile. When examined 24h after encapsulation, survival rates of human neonatal fibroblasts encapsulated in hydrogels polymerized with the phosphinate initiator exceed 95\%, demonstrating the cytocompatibility of this initiating system.},

The removal of the native chromosomes of these bacteria was achieved by double-stranded breaks made by heterologous I-CeuI endonuclease and the degradation activity of endogenous nucleases. We have shown that the cellular machinery remained functional in these chromosome-free SimCells and was able to process various genetic circuits. This includes the glycolysis pathway (composed of 10 genes) and inducible genetic circuits. It was found that the glycolysis pathway significantly extended longevity of SimCells due to its ability to regenerate ATP and NADH/NADPH. The SimCells were able to continuously express synthetic genetic circuits for 10 d after chromosome removal. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated that SimCells can be used as a safe agent (as they cannot replicate) for bacterial therapy. SimCells were used to synthesize catechol (a potent anticancer drug) from salicylic acid to inhibit lung, brain, and soft-tissue cancer cells. SimCells represent a simplified synthetic biology chassis that can be programmed to manufacture and deliver products safely without interference from the host genome.},

  abstract = {Degradation of ssrA-tagged proteins is a central feature of protein-quality control in all bacteria. In Escherichia coli, the ATP-dependent ClpXP and ClpAP proteases are thought to participate in this process, but their relative contributions to degradation of ssrA-tagged proteins in vivo have been uncertain because two adaptor proteins, ClpS and SspB, can modulate proteolysis of these substrates. Here, intracellular levels of these protease components and adaptors were determined during exponential growth and as cells entered early stationary phase. Levels of ClpA and ClpP increased about threefold during this transition, whereas ClpX, ClpS and SspB levels remained nearly constant. Using GFP-ssrA expressed from the chromosome as a degradation reporter, the effects of altered concentrations of different protease components or adaptor proteins were explored. Both ClpXP and ClpAP degraded GFP-ssrA in the cell, demonstrating that wild-type levels of SspB and ClpS do not inhibit ClpAP completely. Upon entry into stationary phase, increased levels of ClpAP resulted in increased degradation of ssrA-tagged substrates. As measured by maximum turnover rates, ClpXP degradation of GFP-ssrA in vivo was significantly more efficient than in vitro. Surprisingly, ClpX-dependent ClpP-independent degradation of GFP-ssrA was also observed. Thus, unfolding of this substrate by ClpX appears to enhance intracellular degradation by other proteases.},

In this work, we developed a synthetic microbial consortium composed of two genetically engineered microbes, a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942) and a heterotrophic bacterium (Pseudomonas putida EM173). These microbial species specialize in the co-culture: cyanobacteria fix CO2 through photosynthetic metabolism and secrete sufficient carbohydrates to support the growth and active metabolism of P.~putida, which has been engineered to consume sucrose and to degrade the environmental pollutant 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT). By encapsulating S.~elongatus within a barium–alginate hydrogel, cyanobacterial cells were protected from the toxic effects of 2,4-DNT, enhancing the performance of the co-culture. The synthetic consortium was able to convert 2,4-DNT with light and CO2 as key inputs, and its catalytic performance was stable over time. Furthermore, cycling this synthetic consortium through low nitrogen medium promoted the sucrose-dependent accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate, an added-value biopolymer, in the engineered P.~putida strain. Altogether, the synthetic consortium displayed the capacity to remediate the industrial pollutant 2,4-DNT while simultaneously synthesizing biopolymers using light and CO2 as the primary inputs.},

  abstract = {Genetic engineering projects often require control over when a protein is degraded. To this end, we use a fusion between a degron and an inactivating peptide that can be added to the N-terminus of a protein. When the corresponding protease is expressed, it cleaves the peptide and the protein is degraded. Three protease:cleavage site pairs from Potyvirus are shown to be orthogonal and active in exposing degrons, releasing inhibitory domains and cleaving polyproteins. This toolbox is applied to the design of genetic circuits as a means to control regulator activity and degradation. First, we demonstrate that a gate can be constructed by constitutively expressing an inactivated repressor and having an input promoter drive the expression of the protease. It is also shown that the proteolytic release of an inhibitory domain can improve the dynamic range of a transcriptional gate (200-fold repression). Next, we design polyproteins containing multiple repressors and show that their cleavage can be used to control multiple outputs. Finally, we demonstrate that the dynamic range of an output can be improved (8-fold to 190-fold) with the addition of a protease-cleaved degron. Thus, controllable proteolysis offers a powerful tool for modulating and expanding the function of synthetic gene circuits.},

We highlight recent work characterizing the evolution and transfer of genetic information across nested scales of host-associated microbiota, which enable resilience to biotic and abiotic perturbations. At the strain level, we consider the preservation and diversification of adaptive information in progeny lineages. At the community level, we consider genetic exchange between distinct microbes in the ecosystem. Finally, we frame microbiomes as open systems subject to acquisition of novel information from foreign ecosystems through invasion by outsider microbes. This review considers mutations in individual microbes, community gene transfer processes and cross-ecosystem information sharing as distinct influences impacting host-associated microbial adaptation in vivo.},

Spectroscopic techniques (e.g., NMR and fluorescence) have been used to study the viability decrease upon aging time of bacteria encapsulated in silica gel materials. Unfortunately, none of these spectroscopic techniques are able to provide insights about the detrimental causes affecting the viability of encapsulated cells. The current work uses cryoscanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) for the in situ study of hydrated biocomposites, given its ability for mapping the water distribution within the host matrix. Cryo-SEM is accompanied by fluorescence experiments which allow correlating the metabolic activity of the cells with their structural integrity. The combination of these techniques provides useful information for the design of new biocomposites where encapsulated bacteria preserve their structural integrity and, thus, are viable for periods of time in a range similar to those found for bacteria suspended in buffered solutions.},

It recognizes its protein substrates through ubiquitin tags and initiates degradation at disordered regions within the substrate. Here we show that the proteasome has pronounced preferences for the amino acid sequence of the regions at which it initiates degradation. Specifically, proteins in which the initiation regions have biased amino acid compositions show longer half-lives in yeast than proteins with unbiased sequences in the regions. The relationship is also observed on a genomic scale in mouse cells. These preferences affect the degradation rates of proteins in vitro, can explain the unexpected stability of natural proteins in yeast and may affect the accumulation of toxic proteins in disease. We propose that the proteasome's sequence preferences provide a second component to the degradation code and may fine-tune protein half-life in cells.},

We hypothesized that biofilms may produce stable chemical signaling gradients in close proximity to surfaces, which influence the growth and development of nearby microcolonies into biofilms. To test this hypothesis, we embossed a layer of PEGDA with 1.5-mm wide chambers in which P. aeruginosa biofilms grew, secreted homoserine lactones (HSLs, small molecule regulators of quorum sensing), and formed spatial and temporal gradients of these compounds. In static growth conditions (i.e., no flow), nascent biofilms secreted N-(3-oxododecanoyl) HSL that formed a gradient in the hydrogel and was detected by P. aeruginosa cells that were ≤8 mm away. Diffusing HSLs increased the growth rate of cells in communities that were {$<$}3 mm away from the biofilm, where the concentration of HSL was {$>$}1 μM, and had little effect on communities farther away. The HSL gradient had no observable influence on biofilm structure. Surprisingly, 0.1-10 μM of N-(3-oxododecanoyl) HSL had no effect on cell growth in liquid culture. The results suggest that the secretion of HSLs from a biofilm enhances the growth of neighboring cells in contact with surfaces into communities and may influence their composition, organization, and diversity.},

Relationships are drawn for the influence of chain length on partition coefficient and solubility; and these, in conjunction with a diffusion layer membrane model, have been incorporated into a general, theoretical expression for maximum steady‐state flux as a function of homolog size. This expression predicts a parabolic dependency as the homologous series is ascended for certain reasonably normal conditions. This model was tested and found valid for an uninterrupted ester series containing from one to seven carbons, utilizing dimethylpolysiloxane membranes. An analysis of the effect of each parameter in the equation was performed with computer assistance. This analysis shows the extent to which the optimum chain length for absorption (barrier penetration) is dependent on controllable and uncontrollable experimental factors. The broad applications of the diffusion layer membrane model with superimposed solubility constraints for the interpretation of membrane transport phenomena, including bioavailability, are detailed.

SspB is an adaptor that delivers ssrA-tagged proteins to the AAA+ protease ClpXP for degradation. To identify new SspB-regulated substrates, we examined proteins captured by ClpXP(trap) in sspB(+) but not sspB(-) strains. RseA(1-108), a fragment of a transmembrane protein that regulates the extracytoplasmic-stress response, fits this criterion. In response to stress, RseA is cleaved on each side of the membrane and is released as a cytoplasmic fragment that remains bound in an inhibitory complex with the sigma(E) transcription factor. Trapping experiments together with biochemical studies show that ClpXP functions in concert with SspB to efficiently recognize and degrade RseA(1-108), and thereby releases sigma(E). Genetic studies confirm that ClpX and SspB participate in induction of the sigma(E) regulon in vivo, acting at the final step of an activating proteolytic cascade. Surprisingly, the SspB-recognition sequence in RseA(1-108) is unrelated to its binding sequence in the ssrA tag. Thus, these experiments elucidate the final steps in induction of the extracytoplasmic stress response and reveal that SspB delivers a broader spectrum of substrates to ClpXP than has been recognized.},

  abstract = {Optimization studies on the synthesis of isonovalal from alpha-pinene oxide by Pseudomonas rhodesiae CIP 107491 operated in a biphasic medium are presented. Three key parameters are identified. The first is the need for a permeabilization of cells by freezing them and then treating the thawed material with an organic solvent such as chloroform, toluene or diethyl ether. This operation allows both enzyme release into the aqueous phase outside the cells and an improvement in the transport properties of both substrate and product across the cell membrane, strongly increasing reaction rates. The second is that the enzyme alpha-pinene oxide lyase, which exhibits an irreversible inactivation by isonovalal (or a by-product), presents a constant turn-over, i.e., the total product synthesis is proportional to the biomass loading and is close to 108 mmol (16.4 g) isonovalal l(-1) g(-1) biomass. The third phenomenon is that the biphasic system used is not phase-transfer-limited, a feature attributed to the spontaneous formation of an oil-in-water emulsion.

PII proteins orchestrate not only key steps of nitrogen and carbon metabolism but rather control a wide range of transporters and can also regulate the production of signaling molecules (c-di-GMP) and cofactors (NAD+). A recently identified class of PII-interacting proteins, which by themselves have no enzymatic activity, modulate cellular processes through protein interactions, further extending the regulatory range of PII proteins.},

Both theory and data suggest that partner choice, where one species preferentially directs aid to the more cooperative members of the other species, is central to cooperation in many mutualisms. However, the theory has only so far considered the evolutionary effects of partner choice on one of the species in a mutualism in isolation. Here, we investigate the co-evolution of cooperation and choice in a choosy host and its symbiont. Our model reveals that even though choice and cooperation may be initially selected, it will often be unstable. This is because choice reduces variation in the symbiont and, therefore, tends to remove the selective incentive for its own maintenance (a scenario paralleled in the lek paradox in female choice and policing in within-species cooperation). However, we also show that when variability is reintroduced into symbionts each generation, in the form of less cooperative individuals, choice is maintained. This suggests that the presence of cheaters and cheater species in many mutualisms is central to the maintenance of partner choice and, paradoxically, cooperation itself.},

An example of such a potential therapeutic is lysostaphin, an enzyme that specifically cleaves the S. aureus peptidoglycan, thereby lysing the bacteria. Here we tracked over time the structural and physical dynamics of single S. aureus cells exposed to lysostaphin, using atomic force microscopy. Topographic images of native cells revealed a smooth surface morphology decorated with concentric rings attributed to newly formed peptidoglycan. Time-lapse images collected following addition of lysostaphin revealed major structural changes in the form of cell swelling, splitting of the septum, and creation of nanoscale perforations. Notably, treatment of the cells with lysostaphin was also found to decrease the bacterial spring constant and the cell wall stiffness, demonstrating that structural changes were correlated with major differences in cell wall nanomechanical properties. We interpret these modifications as resulting from the digestion of peptidoglycan by lysostaphin, eventually leading to the formation of osmotically fragile cells. This study provides new insight into the lytic activity of lysostaphin and offers promising prospects for the study of new antistaphylococcal agents.},

Here, we investigate howthe process of phase separation is used by cells to ensure adaptation to stress.We summarize recent findings and propose that the solubility of important translation factors is specifically affected by changes in physical-chemical parameters such temperature or pH and modulated by intrinsically disordered prion-like domains. These stresstriggered changes in protein solubility induce phase separation into condensates that regulate the activity of the translation factors and promote cellular fitness. Prion-like domains play important roles in this process as environmentally regulated stress sensors and modifier sequences that determine protein solubility and phase behavior. We propose that protein phase separation is an evolutionary conserved feature of proteins that cells harness to regulate adaptive stress responses and ensure survival in extreme environmental conditions.},

We investigated changes in key protein abundances and photophysiological parameters in the model cyanobacteria Synechococcus PCC 7942 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 over a 120 hour time course of iron deprivation.

Applications such as immobilized whole-cell biocatalysts or cellular adsorbents require cell fixation to prevent disintegration, stabilization of the anchored protein from leakage, denaturation or proteolysis, and total loss of cell viability, preventing medium and potential product contamination with cells. In this article we describe the adaptation of a simple two-stage chemical crosslinking procedure based on 'bi-layer encagement' (Tor et al., 1989) for stabilizing Escherichia coli cells expressing an Lpp-OmpA (46-159)-β-lactamase fusion that displays β-1actamase on the cell surface. Bilayer crosslinking and coating the bacteria with a polymeric matrix is accomplished by treating the cells first with either glutaraldehyde or polyglutaraldehyde, followed by secondary crosslinking with polyacrylamide hydrazide. These treatments resulted in a 5- to 25 fold reduction of the thermal inactivation rate constant at 55°C of surface anchored β-lactamase and completely prevented the deterioration of the cells for at least a week of storage at 4°C. The stabilization procedure developed paves the way to scalable biotechnological applications of E. coli displaying surface anchored proteins as whole-cell biocatalysts and adsorbents.},

  abstract = {Bacteria displaying heterologous receptors or enzymes on their surface hold great potential as whole-cell adsorbents and biocatalysts, respectively. For industrial applications, such surface-engineered cells need to be killed and chemically fixed to prevent disintegration and leakage of the displayed proteins under process conditions. It is also highly desirable to couple the chemically stabilized cells onto a solid support matrix for additional mechanical stability, flexibility in reactor choice, and easy separation from processed medium. Recently, we described the development of a readily scalable methodology for cell killing, fixation, and outer membrane stabilization via glutaraldehyde fixation followed by secondary crosslinking (Freeman, A., Abramov, S. and Georgiou, G. 1996. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 52: 625-630). Glutaraldehyde treatment was also found, however, to reduce the specific activity of a model enzyme, beta-lactamase displayed on the surface of E. coli. Here, we show that crosslinking carried out in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors, namely phenyl boronic acid or sodium borate, protects the active site from chemical modification resulting in up to threefold higher specific activities without affecting the cell-stabilizing effect of the glutaraldehyde treatment. To prepare an immobilized whole cell biocatalyst, residual unreacted surface aldehyde groups were employed to immobilize covalently the fixed bacteria onto chitosan-coated cellulose powder. The binding of the bacteria onto chitosan-coated cellulose was quantitative up to cell loading of 83 mg dry cell weight/g of support. Cell immobilization did not introduce mass transfer limitations and created only a modest reduction in Vmax. Thus, chemical crosslinking, affected in presence of reversible active-site inhibitors and coupled with cell immobilization on chitosan-coated cellulose represents a widely useful methodology for the process application of recombinant bacteria displaying surface-anchored heterologous proteins.},

The research is based on well data available at FracFocus.org and water stress indicator maps developed by the World Resources Institute, where water stress denotes the level of competition for water in a given region. The U.S. portion of the analysis is based on hydraulic fracturing water-use data from 39,294 oil and shale gas wells hydraulically fractured between January 2011 through May 2013, as reported to the website FracFocus.org.2 The research shows that 97 billion gallons of water were used, nearly half of it in Texas, followed by Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado and North Dakota. Among more than 250 operating companies reporting to FracFocus in the United States, Chesapeake (ticker: CHK) had the largest amount of water use reported, using nearly 12 billion gallons, followed by EOG Resources (EOG), XTO Energy (owned by Exxon, XOM) and Anadarko Petroleum (APC). Halliburton (HAL), a service provider to many shale energy operators, handled the largest volume of hydraulic fracturing water overall, nearly 25 billion gallons, over a quarter of the water used for hydraulic fracturing nationally, followed by Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI).},

The effects of desorption rates on the feasibility of in situ bioremediation are investigated using an analytical solution to the solute transport equation with rate-limited desorption and first-order decay. Sensitivity analyses are used to identify when desorption or degradation is the rate-limiting process for bioremediation for the range of desorption rates, degradation rates, and equilibrium distribution coefficients reported in the literature. The results show that when the desorption coefficient is large relative to the degradation coefficient (degradation is rate limiting), the performance of in situ bioremediation compared to groundwater extraction is improved as the degradation rate increases. Degradation in the aqueous phase increases the concentration gradient between solid and aqueous phases, increasing the rate of desorption and thus the rate of remediation. However, when the desorption coefficient is small relative to the degradation coefficient (desorption is rate limiting), increasing the degradation rate any further will not improve the performance of in situ bioremediation. For sites that conform to the assumptions of the model and for which model parameters can be measured or estimated, the results can be used to perform a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of in situ bioremediation.},

Mesoporous films are obtained by spin casting surfactant-templated sols onto glass substrates. Small-angle X-ray diffraction results are consistent with hexagonally ordered mesophases in as-synthesized (i.e., surfactant-containing) films. Upon calcination, a 30\% contraction and disordering of these structures occurs. Nile Red is used as a fluorescent probe of both the as-synthesized and calcined films. It is loaded into the samples at subnanomolar levels either prior to spin casting or after calcination. Fluorescence imaging and single-point fluorescence time transients show the dye molecules to be relatively mobile in the as-synthesized samples. In contrast, the molecules appear entrapped at fixed locations in dry calcined films. In calcined films rehydrated under high humidity conditions, the Nile Red molecules again become mobile. Time transients obtained from the as-synthesized and rehydrated samples provide clear evidence for frequent reversible adsorption of the dye to the silica surfaces. Autocorrelations of the time transients provide quantitative data on the mean diffusion coefficients (D = 2.4 x 10(-10) and 2.6 x 10(-10) cm2/s) and mean desorption times (1/k = 25 and 40 s) for the as-synthesized and rehydrated films, respectively. The results prove both water and surfactant play important roles in governing matrix interactions and mass transport.},

  abstract = {Carboxysomes are a class of bacterial microcompartments that form proteinaceous organelles within the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria and play a central role in photosynthetic metabolism by defining a cellular microenvironment permissive to CO2 fixation. Critical aspects of the assembly of the carboxysomes remain relatively unknown, especially with regard to the dynamics of this microcompartment. We have recently expressed an exogenous protease as a way of gaining control over endogenous protein levels, including carboxysomal components, in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcous elongatus PCC 7942. By utilizing this system, proteins that compose the carboxysome can be tuned in real-time as a method to examine carboxysome dynamics. Yet, analysis of subtle changes in carboxysome morphology with microscopy remains a low-throughput and subjective process. Here we use deep learning techniques, specifically a Rotationally Invariant Variational Autoencoder (rVAE), to analyze the fluorescence microscopy images and quantitatively evaluate how carboxysome shell remodelling impacts trends in the morphology of the microcompartment over time. We find that rVAEs are able to assist in the quantitative evaluation of changes in carboxysome location, shape, and size over time. We propose that rVAEs may be a useful tool to accelerate the analysis of carboxysome assembly and dynamics in response to genetic or environmental perturbation, and may be more generally useful to probe regulatory processes involving a broader array of bacterial microcompartments.},

The purified enzyme contained ferrous iron as a prosthetic group. The specific activities decreased with the loss of ferrous iron from the enzyme, and the activity was restored by incubation with ferrous iron in the presence of cysteine. Addition of ferric iron caused the complete inactivation of the enzyme. The molecular weight was estimated to be 250,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single band with a molecular weight of 31,000, indicating that the enzyme consists of eight identical subunits. The enzyme was specific only for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl with a Km value of 87 microM. No significant activity was observed for 3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl, catechol, or 3-methyl- and 4-methylcatechol.

Here we focus on recent progress elucidating the structure and assembly pathways of these machines. As many of the interactions shaped by these machines are of medical importance, they provide an opportunity to develop novel therapeutic approaches to combat important human diseases. Bacteria use multicomponent secretion systems to push effectors, DNA or proteins, into adjacent target cells. Recent structural insights into how these machines work offer new avenues for understanding both pathogenesis and microbial communication.},

Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of new techniques available for transformation, genetic engineering and regulation, including an up-to-date appraisal of current Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) research in cyanobacteria. We also provide an overview of several exciting molecular tools that could be ported to cyanobacteria for more advanced metabolic engineering approaches (e.g., genetic circuit design). Lastly, we introduce a forthcoming mutant library for the model species Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that promises to provide a further powerful resource for the cyanobacterial research community.}

It was found that there is a critical osmotic pressure difference at which the initial spherical capsule shape becomes unstable and invaginations are formed. This critical osmotic pressure was obtained as a function of the wall thickness and the capsule size. A theoretical model is provided which describes the relationship between the critical osmotic pressure, the elasticity modulus, the capsule wall thickness, and the capsule radius. The model was verified by measuring the invagination onset as a function of particle radius and wall thickness. The elasticity modulus of the PSS/PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) polyelectrolyte multilayer was measured as a function of wall thickness and capsule diameter. The modulus ranges between 500 and 750 MPa, which indicates a relatively strongly interconnected polyelectrolyte multilayer structure. With higher molecular weight PAH the elasticity modulus of the PSS/PAH multilayer was slightly enhanced.},

In one device, we integrated 8 individually addressable regions of culture chambers, each only requiring one simple vacuum operation to seed cell lines. Four cell lines were seeded in designated regions in one device via sequential injection with high purity (99.9 \%-100 \%) and cultured for long-term. The on-chip simultaneous culture of HuT 78, Ramos, PC-3 and C166-GFP cells for 48 h was demonstrated with viabilities of 92 \%+/-2 \%, 94 \%+/-4 \%, 96 \%+/-2 \% and 97 \%+/-2 \%, respectively. The longest culture period for C166-GFP cells in this study was 168 h with a viability of 96 \%+/-10 \%. Cell proliferation in each individual side channel can be tracked. Mass transport between the main channel and side channels was achieved through diffusion and studied using fluorescein solution. The main advantage of this device is the capability to perform multiple cell-based assays on the same device for better comparative studies. After treating cells with staurosporine or anti-human CD95 for 16 h, the apoptotic cell percentage of HuT 78, CCRF-CEM, PC-3 and Ramos cells were 36 \%+/-3 \%, 24 \%+/-4 \%, 12 \%+/-2 \%, 18 \%+/-4 \% for staurosporine, and 63 \%+/-2 \%, 45 \%+/-1 \%, 3 \%+/-3 \%, 27 \%+/-12 \% for anti-human CD95, respectively.

However, development of protein-level circuits is limited by availability of designable, orthogonal, and composable tools. Here, with the aid of engineered viral proteases and proteolytic signals, we build two sets of controllable protein units, which can be rationally configured to three tools. Using a protease-based dynamic regulation circuit to fine-tune metabolic flow, we achieve 12.63 g L−1 shikimate titer in minimal medium without inducer. In addition, the carbon catabolite repression is alleviated by protease-based inverter-mediated flux redistribution under multiple carbon sources. By coordinating reaction rate using a protease-based oscillator in E. coli, we achieve d-xylonate productivity of 7.12 g L−1 h−1 with a titer of 199.44 g L−1. These results highlight the applicability of programmable protein switches to metabolic engineering for valuable chemicals production.},

  abstract = {Enzyme biocatalysis plays a very relevant role in the development of many chemical industries, e.g., energy, food or fine chemistry. To achieve this goal, enzyme immobilization is a usual pre-requisite as a solution to get reusable biocatalysts and thus de- crease the price of this relatively expensive com- pound. However, a proper immobilization technique may permit far more than to get a reusable enzyme; it may be used to improve enzyme performance by improving some enzyme limitations: enzyme purity, stability (including the possibility of enzyme reacti- vation), activity, specificity, selectivity, or inhibitions. Among the diverse immobilization techniques, the use of pre-existing supports to immobilize enzymes (via covalent or physical coupling) and the immobili- zation without supports [enzyme crosslinked aggre- gates (CLEAs) or crystals (CLECs)] are the most used or promising ones. This paper intends to give the advantages and disadvantages of the different ex- isting immobilization strategies to solve the different aforementioned enzyme limitations. Moreover, the use of nanoparticles as immobilization supports is achieving an increasing importance, as the nanoparti- cles versatility increases and becomes more accessi- ble to the researchers. We will also discuss here some of the advantages and drawbacks of these non porous supports compared to conventional porous supports. Although there are no universal optimal solutions for all cases, we will try to give some adACHTUNGTRENNUNGvice to select the optimal strategy for each particular enzyme and process, considering the enzyme proper- ties, nature of the process and of the substrate. In some occasions the selection will be compulsory, for example due to the nature of the substrate. In other cases the optimal biocatalyst may depend on the company requirements (e.g., volumetric activity, enzyme stability, etc). 1},

However, a lack of control of material properties has hampered its utility as a scaffold. We have modified collagen via the addition of methacrylate groups to create collagen methacrylamide (CMA) using a synthesis reaction that allows retention of fundamental characteristics of native collagen, including spontaneous fibrillar self-assembly and enzymatic biodegradability. This method allows for a rapid, five-fold increase in storage modulus upon irradiation with 365 nm light. Fibrillar diameter of CMA was not significantly different from native collagen. Collagenolytic degradability of uncrosslinked CMA was minimally reduced, while photocrosslinked CMA was significantly more resistant to degradation. Live/Dead staining demonstrated that a large majority (71\%) of encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells remained viable 24 h after photocrosslinking, which further increased to 81\% after 72 h. This material represents a novel platform for creating mechanically heterogeneous environments.},

  abstract = {15.1 Introduction Agricultural crops comprise of various annual and perennial plant species grown on farm for food, fodder, fiber, and other raw material for industrial uses. The fields used for growing crops differ in environmental conditions, input availability and management practices resulting in differences in resource use and productivity. It is predicted that there will be around 9.1 billion people on the globe by the year 2050 and food consumption will have to increase by 50–70 \% from now [1]. Increase in population requires increase in the agricultural production for food and other requirements. At the same time, there is shrinkage of available resources due to urbanization, developmental activities, and use of land for industries. The demand for food is increasing due to growing population and rising income of majority of the population. There is a possibility of aggravating food crisis because of climate change and diversion of arable lands to other uses [2–3]. Efficient management of available resources is essential to increase productivity of agriculture. In addition, the focus of agricultural production is changing from quantity to desired food quality. Solution to these challenges requires consideration of how crop growth components such as inputs, soils, weather, and management work together to effect plant growth and crop yield. Farmers require increasing amount of information to deal with the transitions in weather, changes in technolo-gy, and transition in demand for food in terms of both quantity and quality. The task to collect, collate, store, and analyze the information is demanding in itself. With information technology opening new opportunities, computer programs in the form of crop models that simulate crop growth and crop yield under different input and environments can help farmers and planners make decisions to manage crops better. Crop modeling is the dynamic simulation of crop growth by numerical integra-tion of constituent processes with the aid of computers [4]. Crop modeling has de-veloped extensively over the past 30 years and a diverse range of crop models have 316 A. K. Bhatia been developed and validated across regions. It combines a scientific approach to enhance understanding with application orientation focusing on output prediction tasks. Crop simulation models have been the desired tools for increasing the effi-ciency of trials on a crop in diverse regions. Precision farming aims to apply crop inputs such as seed, fertilizer, pesticide, and irrigation in a timely and efficient manner. It holds great potential to increase crop productivity through taking up agricultural practices according to weather and soil conditions. This involves management of agricultural practices such as sowing, fertilizer, irrigation, and other inputs on the basis of variability in field conditions. Therefore, it depends on crop growth models to accurately predict responses of crop growth under different weather, soil, and other environmental conditions [5]. Changes in climate have resulted in increase in average temperature and CO 2 levels. Environmental degradation due to industrial and agricultural activities has caused dispersion of pollutants in the subsurface. New strategies are needed to as-sess the impact of these changes. Existing groundwater, soil conservation and ag-ricultural policies and strategies need reconsideration. A system approach, encom-passing the development of crop simulation models is useful for policy makers and scientists to get better insights in the complexity and interaction of the processes affecting the nutrients, pollutants, and chemicals in the dynamic soil–water–crop relations [6].},

  abstract = {© 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH  \&  Co. KGaA. This chapter focusses on selective biocatalytic phosphorylation reactions of metabolites. Phosphoryl group transfer reactions are of fundamental importance for living organisms and a variety of enzyme classes are involved in catalyzing these phosphorylation reactions. A large number of phosphorylases, phosphatases, and phosphotransferases/ kinases have been described as enzymes for the biocatalytic formation of new O-P- bonds, while the number of enzymes catalyzing the formation of N-P-, S-P-, and C-P-bonds is much smaller. Analytical method development, in particular separation and detection methodologies, for the direct analysis of biocatalytic phosphorylation reactions, are described as decisive steps for the assay and screening of novel phosphorylating biocatalysts, for investigating their functional properties and for process design. It is equally important for obtaining product stability data, as the areas of stability for the phosphorylated metabolites are best determined by experiments. As high-energy phosphate compounds are key players in life processes, the most important phosphate compounds are discussed in this chapter. Even though ATP is preferable in most enzymatic phosphorylation reactions, additional phosphoryl donors with varying energy level, availability, and specificity are of great interest. The stereo- and regioselectivity of phosphorylating enzymes offers benefits for the production of phosphate esters. A selection of new emerging phosphorylation reactions is shown. The subchapter on reaction engineering for biocatalytic phosphorylation processes provides basic reaction engineering principles, reaction kinetics, reaction system and process optimization strategies for biocatalytic phosphorylation reactions. The transition from stoichiometric phosphorylation reactions to biocatalytic phosphorylation reactions improves selectivity, safety, health, and environment, reduces the number of reaction steps in existing phosphoryla-tion routes, and decreases the waste-to-product ratio, if the phosphate donor is either recycled or used up in the reaction.},

  abstract = {Messenger RNAs that lack in-frame stop codons promote ribosome stalling and accumulation of aberrant and potentially harmful polypeptides. The SmpB-tmRNA quality control system has evolved to solve problems associated with non-stop mRNAs, by rescuing stalled ribosomes and directing the addition of a peptide tag to the C-termini of the associated proteins, marking them for proteolysis. In Escherichia coli, the ClpXP system is the major contributor to disposal of tmRNA-tagged proteins. We have shown that the AAA+ Lon protease can also degrade tmRNA-tagged proteins, but with much lower efficiency. Here, we present a unique case of enhanced recognition and degradation of an extended Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) tmRNA tag by the MP-Lon protease. We demonstrate that MP-Lon can efficiently and selectively degrade MP-tmRNA-tagged proteins. Most significantly, our studies reveal that the larger (27 amino acids long) MP-tmRNA tag contains multiple discrete signalling motifs for efficient recognition and rapid degradation by Lon. We propose that higher-affinity multipartite interactions between MP-Lon and the extended MP-tmRNA tag have co-evolved from pre-existing weaker interactions, as exhibited by Lon in E. coli, to better fulfil the function of MP-Lon as the sole soluble cytoplasmic protease responsible for the degradation of tmRNA-tagged proteins. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {A variety of animal taxa have benefited from symbioses with photoau-totrophic symbionts that provide fixed carbon in exchange for nutrients and high-light habitats. Corals are one such animal lineage, harboring dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. This genus has remarkably high genetic diversity that trans-lates into morphological, cellular, physiological, and even host infectivity differ-ences. Many corals acquire their symbionts as larvae or recruits upon settlement on the reef, likely from local populations of Symbiodinium present in the sediment. Onset of symbiosis is initiated by host–symbiont recognition and proceeds through a winnowing process where only suitable, healthy Symbiodinium are retained within a host-derived symbiosome membrane. High stress, as is predicted by future climate models, can lead to symbiosis dysfunction and loss of the symbiont from host tissues with negative consequences to the host. Some corals have the ability to exchange their symbiotic partners for those that may be more thermotolerant, but the extent to which coral–dinoflagellate symbioses can acclimatize and adapt to rapid climate change remains to be determined.},

Key principles relevant to the design and application of hydrogels for such applications were reviewed. The first key point is that permeability is a function of both transport and thermodynamic properties, the diffusion coefficient and partition coefficient, respectively, and that these parameters can be evaluated separately. Although the aspect of partitioning often emphasized is size exclusion, this review points out that many other relevant interactions come into play, especially hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and that these phenomena can dominate size exclusion. Similarly, while the diffusion coefficient also is strongly dependent upon size, other interactions can also cause diffusivity to deviate from theories which consider only solute size and gel swelling. For example, the heterogeneity of hydrogel networks can result in permeabilities that fail to decline as much as might be anticipated if networks were uniform.},

The same strains oxidized indene to (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-indandiol and (+)-(1S)-indenol. Purified naphthalene dioxygenase oxidized indan to the same four products formed by strains 9816/11 and JM109(DE3)[pDTG141]. In addition, indene was identified as an intermediate in indan oxidation. The major products formed from indene by purified naphthalene dioxygenase were (+)-(1S)-indenol and (+)-(1R,2S)-indandiol. The results show that naphthalene dioxygenase catalyzes the enantiospecific monooxygenation of indan to (+)-(1S)-indanol and the desaturation of indan to indene, which then serves as a substrate for the formation of (+)-(1R,2S)-indandiol and (+)-(1S)-indenol. The relationship of the desaturase, monooxygenase, and dioxygenase activities of naphthalene dioxygenase is discussed with reference to reactions catalyzed by toluene dioxygenase, plant desaturases, cytochrome P-450, methane monooxygenase, and other bacterial monooxygenases.},

  abstract = {The physiology of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 with respect to growth and carbon starvation was studied. During the transition from growth to nongrowth, the cell shape changes from cylindrical to spheric, a change which is accompanied by reductions in cell size, DNA and ribosome content, and the rate of total protein synthesis. In addition, a pattern of general cross-protection develops, which enables the cells to survive environmental stresses such as high and low temperatures, elevated osmolarity, solvents, and oxidative agents. Cultures are almost fully viable during 1 month of carbon, nitrogen, and multiple-nutrient starvation and are considered to be in an active nondormant state. In contrast, strain KT2442 does not survive well under conditions of sulfate and phosphate starvation.},

  abstract = {Synthetic multicellular systems hold promise as models for understanding natural development of biofilms and higher organisms and as tools for engineering complex multi-component metabolic pathways and materials. However, such efforts require tools to adhere cells into defined morphologies and patterns, and these tools are currently lacking. Here, we report a 100\% genetically encoded synthetic platform for modular cell-cell adhesion in Escherichia coli, which provides control over multicellular self-assembly. Adhesive selectivity is provided by a library of outer membrane-displayed nanobodies and antigens with orthogonal intra-library specificities, while affinity is controlled by intrinsic adhesin affinity, competitive inhibition, and inducible expression. We demonstrate the resulting capabilities for quantitative rational design of well-defined morphologies and patterns through homophilic and heterophilic interactions, lattice-like self-assembly, phase separation, differential adhesion, and sequential layering. Compatible with synthetic biology standards, this adhesion toolbox will enable construction of high-level multicellular designs and shed light on the evolutionary transition to multicellularity. The development of a genetically encoded toolkit of surface-bound nanobodies and antigens in E. coli allows for precise manipulation of cell-cell adhesion and rational design of diverse self-assembled multicellular patterns and morphologies.},

The evolved P450 BM-3 exhibits higher turnover rates than any reported biocatalyst for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons of small to medium chain length (C3-C8). Unlike naturally occurring alkane hydroxylases, the best known of which are the large complexes of methane monooxygenase (MMO) and membrane-associated non-heme iron alkane monooxygenase (AlkB), the evolved enzyme is monomeric, soluble, and requires no additional proteins for catalysis. The evolved alkane hydroxylase was found to be even more active on fatty acids than wild-type BM-3, which was already one of the most efficient fatty acid monooxgenases known. A broad range of substrates including the gaseous alkane propane induces the low to high spin shift that activates the enzyme. This catalyst for alkane hydroxylation at room temperature opens new opportunities for clean, selective hydrocarbon activation for chemical synthesis and bioremediation.},

SbpA reassembles into monomolecular lattices with square (p4) lattice symmetry and a lattice constant of 13.1 nm. Silica layers on the S-layer lattice were formed using tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. In situ quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) measurements showed the adsorption of silica in dependence on the presence of phosphate in the silicate solution and on the preceding chemical modification of the S-layer. An increased amount of precipitated silica could be observed when K2HPO4/KH2PO4 was present in the solution (pH 7.2). Further on, independent of the presence of phosphate the silica deposition was higher on S-layer lattices upon activation of their carboxyl groups with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) compared to native S-layers or EDC treated S-layers when the activated carboxyl groups were blocked with ethylene diamine (EDA). Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy revealed the formation of an amorphous silica gel (SiO2)x·yH2O on the S-layer. The silica surface concentrations on the S-layer was 4 × 10-9 to 2 × 10-8 mol cm-2 depending on the modification of the protein layer and corresponded to 4-21 monolayers of SiO2. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Individual based Models (IbM) must transition from research tools to engineering tools. To make the transition we must aspire to develop large, three dimensional and physically and biologically credible models. Biological credibility can be promoted by grounding, as far as possible, the biology in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic principles are known to have predictive power in microbial ecology. However, this in turn requires a model that incorporates pH and chemical speciation. Physical credibility implies plausible mechanics and a connection with the wider environment. Here, we propose a step toward that ideal by presenting an individual based model connecting thermodynamics, pH and chemical speciation and environmental conditions to microbial growth for 5·105 individuals. We have showcased the model in two scenarios: a two functional group nitrification model and a three functional group anaerobic community. In the former, pH and connection to the environment had an important effect on the outcomes simulated. Whilst in the latter pH was less important but the spatial arrangements and community productivity (that is, methane production) were highly dependent on thermodynamic and reactor coupling. We conclude that if IbM are to attain their potential as tools to evaluate the emergent properties of engineered biological systems it will be necessary to combine the chemical, physical, mechanical and biological along the lines we have proposed. We have still fallen short of our ideals because we cannot (yet) calculate specific uptake rates and must develop the capacity for longer runs in larger models. However, we believe such advances are attainable. Ideally in a common, fast and modular platform. For future innovations in IbM will only be of use if they can be coupled with all the previous advances.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes methods for the direct genetic engineering of the cyanobacterial chromosome and techniques for the analysis of DNA and RNA from the resulting transformants. The DNA in lane B described in the chapter is a by-product of the RNA isolation procedure. The genetic engineering of the cyanobacterial chromosome includes the techniques described in the chapter. The chapter focuses on methods that employ wholly homologous transforming DNA or heterologous sequences, which are flanked by cyanobacterial DNA on either side. The analysis of DNA from transformants is necessary to determine the chromosomal structure following recombination. The recombination events illustrated in the chapter are those that are usually seen, but aberrant events have been observed when the cloned region homologous to the chromosome is small. These events include the deletion of a chromosomal segment and integration at a related locus in the case of a gene family. Southern hybridization can determine whether the expected event has in fact, occurred. It is also important to analyze RNA from transformants, which have been engineered by these methods. A homologous recombination event, which replaces a wild-type gene with another functional allele, should result in the production of a full-length mitochondrial RNA (mRNA), which initiates and terminates properly. The chapter also mentions the instructions of the procedure that describe the preparation of glass fines used in the cyanobacterial total DNA miniprep procedure, which was adapted from the method of Vogelstein and Gillespie. © 1987, Elsevier Inc.

The immiscible PBS/PES blends changed into miscible blends when annealed at 150 degrees C. Gel permeation chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry measurements suggested that the annealing process caused transesterification between the PBS and PES, resulting in the formation of PBS-PES copolyesters. The unannealed blends exhibited phase-separated melts with constituents that crystallized separately. A PBS-rich layer was formed between the PES-rich phase and the glass substrate from the phase-separated melts of the unannealed blends. In contrast, the miscible annealed blends crystallized by two distinct processes. The first process, successive crystallization, involved PBS spherulite formation in the homogeneous melt and PES spherulite nucleation inside the PBS spherulites. The second process involved the simultaneous nucleation of both components from the melt and penetrating growth of the PES spherulites into the PBS spherulites.},

  abstract = {A bacterial isolate, ME102T, was obtained from an n-hexadecane enrichment culture of seawater/sediment samples collected in the harbour of Messina (Italy). This gram-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped bacterium used a narrow spectrum of organic compounds, including aliphatic hydrocarbons, alkanoates and alkanoles, as carbon and energy sources. None of the sugars, organic acids or amino acids tested was used. During cultivation on n-alkanes as the sole source of carbon and energy, the cells formed a biofilm on the surface of the alkane droplets. Large-scale (sometimes {$>$}50\% of the cell mass) intracellular accumulation of alkanoates occurred in cells adsorbed on the alkane surface and under nitrogen-limiting conditions. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that this isolate represents a distinct lineage in the gamma-Proteobacteria and has about 91\% sequence identity to members of Marinobacter and Alcanivorax, the closest genera. Four different types of polar lipid could be detected, phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl ethylamine, phosphatidyl dimethylethylamine and lipids belonging to an unknown type of phospholipid (m/z between 861 and 879). The principal fatty acids in the polar lipid fatty acid profile were 16:0 and 16:1. The putative gene encoding the key enzyme of alkane catabolism, alkane hydroxylase (AlkB), has been cloned. The protein sequence of the putative AlkB of the isolate ME102T was related to the AlkB of Pseudomonas oleovorans and Alcanivorax borkumensis, showing about 60\% sequence identity. On the basis of physiological studies and taking into account the distant phylogenetic position of isolate ME102T relative to previously described organisms, a novel genus and species is proposed, Oleiphilus messinensis gen. nov., sp. nov., within a new family, Oleiphilaceae fam. nov.

Different levels of C18 ligand have been immobilized on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA). We hypothesize that samples with intermediate amounts of C18 ligand would allow albumin to recognize them and bind through its hydrophobic pockets specific for long chain fatty acids. Surface characterization has confirmed increasing amounts of C18 ligand on pHEMA as the percentage of C18 in solution increases, with maximum coverage achieved in 10\% C18 samples. Adsorption from pure albumin solution revealed a small decrease in albumin adsorption from pHEMA to 1\% C18 and 2.5\% C18 samples, but on surfaces with 5\% or higher C18 the amount of adsorbed albumin increased as the percentage of C18 increased. Competitive adsorption studies in the presence of both albumin and fibrinogen, and in the presence of all plasma proteins showed that 1\% C18 and 2.5\% C18 were the only surfaces selective for albumin, and that the presence of all plasma proteins may even potentiate albumin adsorption. Reversibility studies demonstrated that both 2.5\% C18 and 5\% C18 samples exchange (125)I-albumin selectively in the presence of both unlabeled albumin and plasma, but 2.5\% C18 samples presented higher exchangeability rates (58\%). Clotting times using recalcified plasma revealed that samples with none or small amounts of C18 (pHEMA to 5\% C18) did not shorten the clotting time compared to the negative control (polystyrene), indicating low activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade.},

  abstract = {Porous amorphous silica obtained by the sol-gel method with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as structure directing agent is investigated. In this paper, we use the PEG with molecular weight 400, 1300, 3000, 6000, 20,000, 100,000, 200,000 and vary the concentration of the polymer solution in a wide range. The analysis of nitrogen adsorption-desorption data and transmission electron microscopy shows that depending on the combination of molecular weight and concentration of the PEG solution the microporous and mesoporous silica materials can be obtained. It was determined that using the solution of PEG-400, 1300 independently of the concentration the mesoporous silica is formed. When the diluted and concentrated solutions of PEG-3000, 6000, 20,000, 100,000, 200,000 are used it produces also the mesoporous materials. In the field of transitional concentrations of PEG the microporous silica with fraction of micropores equals 95\% is generated.

  abstract = {Trans-acting regulators provide novel opportunities to study essential genes and regulate metabolic pathways. We have adapted the clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system from Streptococcus pyogenes to repress genes in trans in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 (hereafter PCC 7002). With this approach, termed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), transcription of a specific target sequence is repressed by a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein recruited to the target DNA by base-pair interactions with a single guide RNA that is complementary to the target sequence. We adapted this system for PCC 7002 and achieved conditional and titratable repression of a heterologous reporter gene, yellow fluorescent protein. Next, we demonstrated the utility of finely tuning native gene expression by downregulating the abundance of phycobillisomes. In addition, we created a conditional auxotroph by repressing synthesis of the carboxysome, an essential component of the carbon concentrating mechanism cyanobacteria use to fix atmospheric CO2. Lastly, we demonstrated a novel strategy for increasing central carbon flux by conditionally downregulating a key node in nitrogen assimilation. The resulting cells produced 2-fold more lactate than a baseline engineered cell line, representing the highest photosynthetically generated productivity to date. This work is the first example of titratable repression in cyanobacteria using CRISPRi, enabling dynamic regulation of essential processes and manipulation of flux through central carbon metabolism. This tool facilitates the study of essential genes of unknown function and enables groundbreaking metabolic engineering capability, by providing a straightforward approach to redirect metabolism and carbon flux in the production of high-value chemicals.},

To engineer these organisms and manipulate their metabolic pathways, the biotechnology community has developed genetic tools to control gene expression. Many native cyanobacterial promoters and related sequence elements have been used to regulate genes of interest, and heterologous tools that use non-native small molecules to induce gene expression have been demonstrated. Overall, IPTG-based induction systems seem to be leaky and initially demonstrate small dynamic ranges in cyanobacteria. Consequently, a variety of other induction systems have been optimized to enable tighter control of gene expression. Tools require significant optimization because they function quite differently in cyanobacteria when compared to analogous use in model heterotrophs. We hypothesize that these differences are due to fundamental differences in physiology between organisms. This review is not intended to summarize all known products made in cyanobacteria nor the performance (titer, rate, yield) of individual strains, but instead will focus on the genetic tools and the inherent aspects of cellular physiology that influence gene expression in cyanobacteria.},

This included negative staining and ultrathin section analysis. Different morphological and ultrastructural features of mutant cells were identified. Ftn2 and Ftn6 mutants exhibited particularly elongated cells characterized by significantly changed shape in comparison with the wild type. There was irregular bending, curving, spiralization, and bulges as well as cell branching. Elongated mutant cells were able to initiate cytokinesis simultaneously in several division sites which were localized irregularly along the cell. Damaged rigidity of the cell wall was typical of many cells for both mutants. Thylakoids of mutants showed modified arrangement and ultrastructural organization. Carboxysome-like structures without a shell and/or without accurate polyhedral packing protein particles were often detected in the mutants. However, in the case of Ftn2 and Ftn6, the average number of carboxysomes per section was less than in the wild type by a factor of 4 and 2, respectively. These multiple morphological and ultrastructural changes in mutant cells evinced pleiotropic responses which were induced by mutations in cell division genes ftn2 and ftn6. Ultrastructural abnormalities of Ftn2 and Ftn6 mutants were consistent with differences in their proteomes. These results could support the significance of FTN2 and FTN6 proteins for both cyanobacterial cell division and cellular physiology.},

This modification is mediated by SsrA RNA (also called 10Sa RNA and tmRNA) and marks the tagged polypeptide for proteolysis. Degradation in vivo of lambda repressor amino-terminal domain variants bearing this carboxy-terminal SsrA peptide tag is shown here to depend on the cytoplasmic proteases ClpXP and ClpAP. Degradation in vitro of SsrA-tagged substrates was reproduced with purified components and required a substrate with a wild-type SsrA tail, the presence of both ClpP and either ClpA or ClpX, and ATP. Clp-dependent proteolysis accounts for most degradation of SsrA-tagged amino-domain substrates at 32 degrees C, but additional proteases contribute to the degradation of some of these SsrA-tagged substrates at 39 degrees C. The existence of multiple cytoplasmic proteases that function in SsrA quality-control surveillance suggests that the SsrA tag is designed to serve as a relatively promiscuous signal for proteolysis. Having diverse degradation systems able to recognize this tag may increase degradation capacity, permit degradation of a wide variety of different tagged proteins, or allow SsrA-tagged proteins to be degraded under different growth conditions.},

As with any such discipline, communication between researchers and periodic evaluation facilitate technical progress. Complications arise when, from author to author, terminology and basic experimental techniques become incongruous and easy comparisons obviated. Several reviews on the discipline have been published that treat the historical aspects and modern research. No such review has been published since 1990. This present work focuses on post-1990 literature, not repeating the vast history. In all, 47 reference works were investigated, of which 36 are articles concerning the atomization of liquids by primarily electrical means. As a method to show the diverse range of liquids that can be electrically atomized and to illuminate the discontinuities of data within this range, 70 liquids, as presented in the atomization references, are catalogued by reported liquid properties. The nomenclature of electrical atomization spray modes suggested by Cloupeau and Prunet-Foch (J. Electrostatics 25, 165, 1990) has been continued. Three additional definitions are presented. Suggestions as to the nomenclature and unit system used, as well as the reporting of liquid properties and experimental configurations, have been made with the purpose of facilitating comparison of future experimental results. © 1994.},

Photosynthetic growth is heavily dependent on irradiance, therefore photobioreactor design optimization requires comprehensive screening of irradiance variables, such as intensity, time variance and spectral composition. Here we present a microfluidic irradiance assay which leverages liquid crystal display technology to provide multiplexed screening of irradiance conditions on growth. An array of 238 microreactors are operated in parallel with identical chemical environments. The approach is demonstrated by performing three irradiance assays. The first assay evaluates the effect of intensity on growth, quantifying saturating intensity. The second assay quantifies the influence of time-varied intensity and the threshold frequency for growth. Lastly, the coupled influence of red-blue spectral composition and intensity is assessed. Each multiplexed assay is completed within three days. In contrast, completing the same number of experiments using conventional incubation flasks would require several years. Not only does our approach enable more rapid screening, but the short optical path avoids self-shading issues inherent to flask based systems.},

The specificity of the dye for lipid droplets was assessed on cultured aortic smooth muscle cells and on cultured peritoneal macrophages that were incubated with acetylated low density lipoprotein to induce cytoplasmic lipid overloading. Better selectivity for cytoplasmic lipid droplets was obtained when the cells were viewed for yellow-gold fluorescence (excitation, 450-500 nm; emission, greater than 528 nm) rather than red fluorescence (excitation, 515-560 nm; emission, greater than 590 nm). Nile red-stained, lipid droplet-filled macrophages exhibited greater fluorescence intensity than did nile red-stained control macrophages, and the two cell populations could be differentiated and analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Such analyses could be performed with either yellow-gold or red fluorescence, but when few lipid droplets per cell were present, the yellow-gold fluorescence was more discriminating. Nile red exhibits properties of a near-ideal lysochrome. It is strongly fluorescent, but only in the presence of a hydrophobic environment. The dye is very soluble in the lipids it is intended to show, and it does not interact with any tissue constituent except by solution. Nile red can be applied to cells in an aqueous medium, and it does not dissolve the lipids it is supposed to reveal.},

In an effort to encapsulate the breadth over which fluorescent biosensors have expanded, we endeavored to assemble a comprehensive list of published engineered biosensors, and we discuss many of the molecular designs utilized in their development. Then, we review how the high temporal and spatial resolution afforded by fluorescent biosensors has aided our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling networks at the cellular and subcellular level.

We engineered an inducible protein degradation system for use in Bacillus subtilis based on Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentusssrA tags and SspB adaptors that deliver proteins to ClpXP for proteolysis. In this system, modified ssrA degradation tags are fused onto the 3′ end of the genes of interest. Unlike wild-type ssrA, these modified tags require the adaptor protein SspB to target tagged proteins for proteolysis. In the absence of SspB, the tagged proteins accumulate to near physiological levels. By inducing SspB expression from a regulated promoter, the tagged substrates are rapidly delivered to the B. subtilis ClpXP protease for degradation. We used this system to degrade the reporter GFP and several native B. subtilis proteins, including, the transcription factor ComA, two sporulation kinases (KinA, KinB) and the sporulation and chromosome partitioning protein Spo0J. We also used modified E. coli and C. crescentus ssrA tags to independently control the degradation of two different proteins in the same cell. These tools will be useful for studying biological processes in B. subtilis and can potentially be modified for use in other bacteria. © 2008 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Two-component systems are a class of sensors that enable bacteria to respond to environmental and cell-state signals. The canonical system consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase that autophosphorylates in response to a signal and transfers the phosphate to an intracellular response regulator. Bacteria typically have dozens of two-component systems. The key questions are whether these systems are linear and, if they are, how cross talk between systems is buffered. In this work, we studied the EnvZ/OmpR and CpxA/CpxR systems from Escherichia coli, which have been shown previously to exhibit slow cross talk in vitro. Using in vitro radiolabeling and a rapid quenched-flow apparatus, we experimentally measured 10 biochemical parameters capturing the cognate and non-cognate phosphotransfer reactions between the systems. These data were used to parameterize a mathematical model that was used to predict how cross talk is affected as different genes are knocked out. It was predicted that significant cross talk between EnvZ and CpxR only occurs for the triple mutant DeltaompR DeltacpxA DeltaactA-pta. All seven combinations of these knockouts were made to test this prediction and only the triple mutant demonstrated significant cross talk, where the cpxP promoter was induced 280-fold upon the activation of EnvZ. Furthermore, the behavior of the other knockouts agrees with the model predictions. These results support a kinetic model of buffering where both the cognate bifunctional phosphatase activity and the competition between regulator proteins for phosphate prevent cross talk in vivo.},

In contrast to other members of the ring cleaving dioxygenase family, the transient kinetics of the extradiol dioxygenase catalytic cycle have been difficult to study because the iron is nearly colorless and EPR silent. Here, it is shown that the reaction cycle kinetics can be monitored by utilizing the alternative substrate 4-nitrocatechol (4NC), which is also cleaved in the proximal extradiol position. Changes in the optical spectrum of 4NC occurring as a result of ionization, environmental changes, and ring cleavage allow both the substrate binding and product formation phases of the reaction to be studied. It is shown that substrate binding occurs in a four-step process probably involving binding to two ionization states of the enzyme at different rates. Following an initial rapid binding of the monoanionic 4NC in the active site, slower binding to the Fe(II) and conversion to the dianionic form occur. The bound dianionic 4NC reacts rapidly with O2 in four additional steps, apparently occurring in sequence. On the basis of the optical properties of the intermediates, these steps are hypothesized to be O2 binding to the iron, isomerization of the resulting complex, ring opening, and product release. The natural substrate appears to form the same intermediates but with much larger rate constants. These are the first transient intermediates to be reported for an extradiol dioxygenase reaction.},

  abstract = {Electron microscopic analysis was used to study cells of Escherichia coli B and K-12 during and after amino acid starvation. The results confirmed our previous conclusion that cell division and initiation of DNA replication occur at a smaller cell volume after amino acid starvation. Although during short starvation periods, the number of constricting cells decreased due to residual division, it appears that during prolonged starvation, cells of E. coli B and K-12 were capable of initiating new constrictions. During amino acid starvation, cell diameter decreased significantly. The decrease was reversed only after two generation times after the resumption of protein synthesis and was larger in magnitude than that previously observed before division (F. J. Trueba and C. L. Woldringh, J. Bacteriol. 142:869-878, 1980). This decrease in cell diameter correlates with synchronization of cell division which has been shown to occur after amino acid starvation. In newly divided cells of Escherichia coli, the first division after amino acid starvation, as well as the first initiation of DNA replication, occurs earlier than in unstarved cells. Measurements of cell volume, performed with the Coulter Counter, as well as calculations of cell mass, indicate that these main events of the cell cycle occur long before the cells can increase their size to that at which these events occur in untreated cells (4, 11). In asynchronous, randomly dividing cultures of E. coli B and K-12, amino acid starvation results in a synchronous cell division soon after resumption of protein synthesis (12). The next round of DNA replica-tion also starts in synchrony (unpublished data) and results in a few synchronized division cycles (12). To understand how amino acid starvation brings about a shift forward in the subsequent cell cycles, we examined a few parameters which might play a role in the cell cycle and in induction of division. Important parameters in this respect are cell size and cell shape, which we examined by using electron microscopic measurements of bacteria obtained by the agar filtration technique (17). The results summarized in this communication confirmed our previous conclusion that after amino acid starvation, cells divide and initiate DNA replication when their size is smaller than that at which those events occur in untreated cells. In addition, the results indicated that during amino acid starvation of cells of E. coli B and K-12, there was a significant decrease in cell diameter. This decrease correlates with the synchronization of cell division which occurs at the end of the starvation, since it has not been observed in E. coli B/r, which could not be synchronized by amino acid starvation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions. The bacterial strains used were E. coli B ilvA thyA; E. coli B/r H266 (our laboratory collection); E. coli B/r A thr (kindly supplied by A. Zaritsky) and its methionine-requiring mutant, B/r thr met (isolated in our laboratory after ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis and penicillin selection); and E. coli K-12 DG76 (F-thyA47 leu-6 str-163 [18], kindly supplied by B. Bach-man) and K-12 428 thi pro his (from our laboratory collection). Cells were grown with shaking at 37°C in minimal salt medium (6) supplemented with required amino acids (20 Fg/ml) and thymine (20 Fg/ml). The carbon source was added to a final concentration of 0.2\%. At the start of the experiments, the cells had been growing exponentially for at least 10 generations. Newborn cells of E. coli B were obtained by the membrane elution technique of Helmstetter (6). Newborn cells of E. coli K-12 were obtained by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (2). Amino acid starvation. Amino acid starvation was initiated in one of the following ways: (i) addition of 5 X 10-4 M of the methionine analog a-methylmethio-nine (oaMM) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), which induces methionine starvation by inhibiting the first biosynthetic enzyme for methionine (14); (ii) addition of 5-methyltryptophan, which inhibits tryp-35},

Cells of strains SL014B61A(T) and SL014B11A were motile, Gram-negative and rod-shaped. Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations of between 0 and 15 \% and at temperatures of between 10 and 45 degrees C. Strain SL014B61A(T) had Q9 as the major respiratory quinone and C16 : 0 (21.2 \%), C18 : 1omega9c (20.3 \%), C16 : 1omega7c (7.3 \%) and C16 : 1omega9c (6.4 \%) as predominant fatty acids. The G+C content of the DNA was 57.9 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain SL014B61A(T) belonged to the genus Marinobacter in the class Gammaproteobacteria. Strain SL014B61A(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Marinobacter bryozoorum (97.9 \%) and showed 97.8 \% sequence similarity to Marinobacter lipolyticus. DNA-DNA relatedness to the reference strains Marinobacter bryozoorum and Marinobacter lipolyticus was 35.5 \% and 33.8 \%, respectively. On the basis of these data, it is proposed that strains SL014B61A(T) and SL014B11A represent a novel species, Marinobacter gudaonensis sp. nov. The type strain is strain SL014B61A(T) (=DSM 18066(T)=LMG 23509(T)=CGMCC 1.6294(T)).},

To test the hypothesis that sorbed naphthalene is unavailable to degradative microorganisms, we developed a simple kinetic method to examine the rates and extents of naphthalene degradation in soil-free and soil-containing systems in a comparison of two bacterial species.  The method is predicated on the first-order dependence of the initial mineralization rate on the naphthalene concentration when the latter is below the Michaelis-Menten half-saturation constant (K(m)) for naphthalene for the organism under study.  Rates and extents of mineralization were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of data by using both a simple first-order model and a three-parameter, coupled degradation-desorption model described for the first time here.  Bioavailability assays with two bacterial species (Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484 and a gram-negative soil isolate, designated NP-Alk) gave dramatically different results.  For NP-Alk, sorption limited both the rate and extent of naphthalene mineralization, in accordance with values predicted on the basis of the equilibrium aqueous-phase naphthalene concentrations.  For strain 17484, both the rates and extents of naphthalene mineralization exceeded the predicted values and resulted in enhanced rates of naphthalene desorption from the soils.  We conclude that there are important organism-specific properties which make generalizations regarding the bioavailability of sorbed substrates inappropriate.},

The maintenance of naphthalene utilization activity is studied in Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 17484) and an Alcaligenes sp. (strain NP-Alk) under different batch culture conditions. Levels of activity decreased exponentially in stationary phase with half-lives of 43 and 13 h for strains ATCC 17484 and NP-Alk, respectively. Activity half-lives were 2.7 and 5.3 times longer, respectively, in starved cultures than in stationary-phase cultures following growth on naphthalene. The treatment of starved cultures with chloramphenicol caused a loss of activity more rapid than that measured in untreated starved cultures, suggesting a continued enzyme synthesis in starved cultures in the absence of a substrate. Following growth in nutrient medium, activity decreased to undetectable levels in the Alcaligenes sp. but remained at measurable levels in the pseudomonad even after 9 months. The induction of naphthalene degradation activities in these cultures, when followed by radiorespirometry with 14C-labeled naphthalene as the substrate, was consistent with activity maintenance data. In the pseudomonad, naphthalene degradation activity was present constitutively at low levels under all growth conditions and was rapidly (in approximately 15 min) induced to high levels upon exposure to naphthalene. Adaptation in the uninduced Alcaligenes sp. occurred after many hours of exposure to naphthalene. In vivo labeling with 35S, to monitor the extent of de novo enzyme synthesis by naphthalene-challenged cells, provided an independent confirmation of the results.},

Biofilm bioreactors offer many advantages and may be successfully used for this purpose. Two stirred-tank reactors and one packed-bed reactor were tested in a continuous mode. Continuous cultivation allows microbial selection to take place whilst adhesive growth provides a high degradation capacity and process stability. The reactors were inoculated with mixed microbial populations to favour complete metabolism and to prevent metabolite accumulation and substrate inhibition effects. Phenol, o-cresol, quinoline, dibenzofuran, acenaphthene and phenanthrene were used as model contaminants and constituted the sole energy and carbon sources. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was initially set to 2.5 days for a period of several months to allow the establishment of a stable biofilm and was then gradually decreased. All the compounds were found to be degraded by more than 90\% at HRT of 3 h or more. Neither substrate inhibition nor metabolite accumulation effects were observed. The stirred-tank configuration was found to be the most efficient for use with high loads. No improvement in the degradation capacity could be achieved by increasing the biofilm surface in these reactors, illustrating that the limiting factor may be the mass transfer limitations rather than the availability of the biofilm surface. Finally, anaerobic treatment was successfully achieved, confirming the potential for remediation of contaminated sites under anaerobic conditions, providing that alternative electron acceptors are present.},

Here, we engineered a genetic toolbox comprising libraries of promoters, Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS), and protein degradation tags to precisely tune gene expression in B. subtilis. We first designed a modular Expression Operating Unit (EOU) facilitating parts assembly and modifications and providing a standard genetic context for gene circuits implementation. We then selected native, constitutive promoters of B. subtilis and efficient RBS sequences from which we engineered three promoters and three RBS sequence libraries exhibiting ∼14 000-fold dynamic range in gene expression levels. We also designed a collection of SsrA proteolysis tags of variable strength. Finally, by using fluorescence fluctuation methods coupled with two-photon microscopy, we quantified the absolute concentration of GFP in a subset of strains from the library. Our complete promoters and RBS sequences library comprising over 135 constructs enables tuning of GFP concentration over five orders of magnitude, from 0.05 to 700 μM. This toolbox of regulatory components will support many research and engineering applications in B. subtilis.},

NL4Py provides both headless (no graphical user interface) and GUI NetLogo workspace control through Python. Spurred on by the increasing availability of open-source computation and machine learning libraries on the Python package index, there is an increasing demand for such rapid, parallel execution of agent-based models through Python. NetLogo, being the language of choice for a majority of agent-based modeling driven research projects, requires an integration to Python for researchers looking to perform statistical analyses of agent-based model output using these libraries. Unfortunately, until the recent introduction of PyNetLogo, and now NL4Py, such a controller was unavailable. This article provides a detailed introduction into the usage of NL4Py and explains its client-server software architecture, highlighting architectural differences to PyNetLogo. A step-by-step demonstration of global sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration of the Wolf Sheep Predation model is then performed through NL4Py. Finally, NL4Py's performance is benchmarked against PyNetLogo and its combination with IPyParallel, and shown to provide significant savings in execution time over both configurations.},

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as ‘predictive’, in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

In addition, the rapid modernization of society has also led to the generation of huge amount of materials of little value that have no fruitful use.

The utilization of all such materials as low-cost adsorbents for the treatment of wastewater may make them of some value.

In each case, it is possible (i) to form thin silica layers or gels controllably that enable the preservation of the supramolecular assembly over time and under adverse environmental conditions and (ii) to tune the structure of the silica gels so as to optimize solute accessibility while at the same time preserving functional dynamic properties of the encapsulated phospholipid assembly. The process allows precise temporal and spatial control of silica polymerization kinetics through the control of precursor delivery at room temperature and does not require or produce high concentrations of injurious chemicals that can compromise the function of biomolecular assemblies; it also does not require additives.

Here we design a microfluidic platform to investigate how the spatial arrangement of microbes impacts gene expression and growth. We elucidate key biochemical parameters that dictate the mapping between spatial positioning and gene expression patterns. We show that distance can establish a low-pass filter to periodic inputs and can enhance the fidelity of information processing. Positive and negative feedback can play disparate roles in the synchronization and robustness of a genetic oscillator distributed between two strains to spatial separation. Quantification of growth and metabolite release in an amino-acid auxotroph community demonstrates that the interaction network and stability of the community are highly sensitive to temporal perturbations and spatial arrangements. In sum, our microfluidic platform can quantify spatiotemporal parameters influencing diffusion-mediated interactions in microbial consortia.},

Tag recognition is normally viewed as a passive reaction. By contrast, for the AAA+ Lon protease, we show that degron tags are also regulatory elements that determine protease activity levels. Indeed, different tags fused to the same protein change degradation speeds and energetic efficiencies by 10-fold or more. Degron binding to multiple sites in the Lon hexamer appears to differentially stabilize specific enzyme conformations, including one with high protease and low ATPase activity, and results in positively cooperative degradation. These allosteric mechanisms allow Lon to operate in either a fast or slow proteolysis mode, according to specific physiological needs, and may help maximize degradation of misfolded proteins following stress-induced denaturation.},

  abstract = {Stalled ribosomes in bacteria are rescued by the tmRNA system. In this process, the nascent polypeptide is modified by the addition of a short C-terminal sequence called the ssrA tag, which is encoded by tmRNA and allows normal termination and release of ribosomal subunits. In most bacteria, ssrA-tagged proteins are degraded by the AAA+ protease, ClpXP. However, in bacterial species of the genus Mycoplasma, genes for ClpXP and many other proteins were lost through reductive evolution. Interestingly, Mycoplasma ssrA tag sequences are very different from the tags in other bacteria. We report that ssrA-tagged proteins in Mesoplasma florum, a Mycoplasma species, are efficiently recognized and degraded by the AAA+ Lon protease. Thus, retaining degradation of ssrA-tagged translation products was apparently important enough during speciation of Mycoplasma to drive adaptation of the ssrA tag to a different protease. These results emphasize the importance of coupling proteolysis with tmRNA-mediated tagging and ribosome rescue.},

Degradation of denatured polypeptides by Lon and related ATP-dependent AAA(+) proteases helps prevent toxic aggregates formation and other deleterious consequences, but how these destructive enzymatic machines distinguish between damaged and properly folded proteins is poorly understood. Here, we show that Escherichia coli Lon recognizes specific sequences -- rich in aromatic residues -- that are accessible in unfolded polypeptides but hidden in most native structures. Denatured polypeptides lacking such sequences are poor substrates. Lon also unfolds and degrades stably folded proteins with accessible recognition tags. Thus, protein architecture and the positioning of appropriate targeting sequences allow Lon degradation to be dependent or independent of the folding status of a protein. Our results suggest that Lon can recognize multiple signals in unfolded polypeptides synergistically, resulting in nanomolar binding and a mechanism for discriminating irreversibly damaged proteins from transiently unfolded elements of structure.},

It is used as a synthetic biology prototyping tool for simulating multicellular biocircuits and microbial consortia. In this work, we present several extensions made to gro that improve the performance of the simulator, make it easier to use, and provide new functionalities. The new version of gro is between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude faster than the original version. It is able to grow microbial colonies with up to 10 5  cells in less than 10 min. A new library, CellEngine, accelerates the resolution of spatial physical interactions between growing and dividing cells by implementing a new shoving algorithm. A genetic library, CellPro, based on Probabilistic Timed Automata, simulates gene expression dynamics using simplified and easy to compute digital proteins. We also propose a more convenient language specification layer, ProSpec, based on the idea that proteins drive cell behavior. CellNutrient, another library, implements Monod-based growth and nutrient uptake functionalities. The intercellular signaling management was improved and extended in a library called CellSignals. Finally, bacterial conjugation, another local cell-cell communication process, was added to the simulator. To show the versatility and potential outreach of this version of gro, we provide studies and novel examples ranging from synthetic biology to evolutionary microbiology. We believe that the upgrades implemented for gro have made it into a powerful and fast prototyping tool capable of simulating a large variety of systems and synthetic biology designs.},

In situ AFM measurements confirmed the importance of ionic bonds in the formation of crystalline SbpA layers at silicon supports. Rupture of the protein subunits with a metal chelator from the crystalline lattice of SbpA was visualized in situ by AFM.

Here we show that there is no overlap of abundant bacterial taxa between the microbiotas of the mammalian gut and plant roots, whereas taxa overlap does exist between fish gut and plant root communities. A comparison of root and gut microbiota composition in multiple host species belonging to the same evolutionary lineage reveals host phylogenetic signals in both eukaryotic kingdoms. The reasons underlying striking differences in microbiota composition in independently evolved, yet functionally related, organs in plants and animals remain unclear but might include differences in start inoculum and niche-specific factors such as oxygen levels, temperature, pH, and organic carbon availability.},

However, for several applications, smaller metabolic (core) models are needed. Using a recently introduced reduction algorithm and the latest E. coli genome-scale reconstruction iJO1366, we derived EColiCore2, a model of the central metabolism of E. coli. EColiCore2 is a subnetwork of iJO1366 and preserves predefined phenotypes including optimal growth on different substrates. The network comprises 486 metabolites and 499 reactions, is accessible for elementary-modes analysis and can, if required, be further compressed to a network with 82 reactions and 54 metabolites having an identical solution space as EColiCore2. A systematic comparison of EColiCore2 with its genome-scale parent model iJO1366 reveals that several key properties (flux ranges, reaction essentialities, production envelopes) of the central metabolism are preserved in EColiCore2 while it neglects redundancies along biosynthetic routes. We also compare calculated metabolic engineering strategies in both models and demonstrate, as a general result, how intervention strategies found in a core model allow the identification of valid strategies in a genome-scale model. Overall, EColiCore2 holds promise to become a reference model of E. coli's central metabolism.},

  abstract = {Triangular silver nanoparticles ( approximately 100 nm wide and 50 nm high) have remarkable optical properties. In particular, the peak extinction wavelength, lambda(max) of their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum is unexpectedly sensitive to nanoparticle size, shape, and local ( approximately 10-30 nm) external dielectric environment. This sensitivity of the LSPR lambda(max) to the nanoenvironment has allowed us to develop a new class of nanoscale affinity biosensors. The essential characteristics and operational principles of these LSPR nanobiosensors will be illustrated using the well-studied biotin-streptavidin system. Exposure of biotin-functionalized Ag nanotriangles to 100 nM streptavidin (SA) caused a 27.0 nm red-shift in the LSPR lambda(max). The LSPR lambda(max) shift, DeltaR/DeltaR(max), versus [SA] response curve was measured over the concentration range 10(-)(15) M {$<$} [SA] {$<$} 10(-)(6) M. Comparison of the data with the theoretical normalized response expected for 1:1 binding of a ligand to a multivalent receptor with different sites but invariant affinities yielded approximate values for the saturation response, DeltaR(max) = 26.5 nm, and the surface-confined thermodynamic binding constant K(a,surf) = 10(11) M(-)(1). At present, the limit of detection (LOD) for the LSPR nanobiosensor is found to be in the low-picomolar to high-femtomolar region. A strategy to amplify the response of the LSPR nanobiosensor using biotinylated Au colloids and thereby further improve the LOD is demonstrated. Several control experiments were performed to define the LSPR nanobiosensor's response to nonspecific binding as well as to demonstrate its response to the specific binding of another protein. These include the following: (1) electrostatic binding of SA to a nonbiotinylated surface, (2) nonspecific interactions of prebiotinylated SA to a biotinylated surface, (3) nonspecific interactions of bovine serum albumin to a biotinylated surface, and (4) specific binding of anti-biotin to a biotinylated surface. The LSPR nanobiosensor provides a pathway to ultrasensitive biodetection experiments with extremely simple, small, light, robust, low-cost instrumentation that will greatly facilitate field-portable environmental or point-of-service medical diagnostic applications.},

It is evident that biofilm formation is an ancient and integral component of the prokaryotic life cycle, and is a key factor for survival in diverse environments. Recent advances show that biofilms are structurally complex, dynamic systems with attributes of both primordial multicellular organisms and multifaceted ecosystems. Biofilm formation represents a protected mode of growth that allows cells to survive in hostile environments and also disperse to colonize new niches. The implications of these survival and propagative mechanisms in the context of both the natural environment and infectious diseases are discussed in this review.},

We discovered significant up-regulation of Hydra genes encoding a phosphate transporter and glutamine synthetase suggesting regulated nutrition supply between host and symbionts. Interestingly, supplementing the medium with glutamine temporarily supports in vitro growth of the otherwise obligate symbiotic Chlorella, indicating loss of autonomy and dependence on the host. Genome sequencing of Chlorella sp. A99 revealed a large number of amino acid transporters and a degenerated nitrate assimilation pathway, presumably as consequence of the adaptation to the host environment. Our observations portray ancient symbiotic interactions as a codependent partnership in which exchange of nutrients appears to be the primary driving force.},

  abstract = {The adsorption equilibrium isotherms of five phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions onto granular activated carbon (GAC) were studied and modeled. Phenol (Ph), 2-chlorophenol (2-CP), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) were chosen for the adsorption tests. To predict the adsorption isotherms and to determine the characteristic parameters for process design, seven isotherm models: Langmuir (five linear forms), Freundlich, Elovich, Temkin, Fowler-Guggenheim, Kiselev, and Hill-de Boer models were applied to experimental data. The results reveal that the adsorption isotherm models fitted the data in the order: Fowler-Guggenheim {$>$} Hill-de Boer {$>$} Temkin {$>$} Freundlich {$>$} Kiselev {$>$} Langmuir isotherms. Adsorption isotherms modeling shows that the interaction of phenolic compounds with activated carbon surface is localized monolayer adsorption, that is adsorbed molecules are adsorbed at definite, localized sites. Each site can accommodate only one molecule. The interaction among adsorbed molecules is repulsive and there is no association between them, adsorption is carried out on energetically different sites and is an exothermic process. Uptake of phenols increases in the order Ph {$<$} 2-CP {$<$} 4-CP {$<$} DCP {$<$} TCP, which correlates well with respective increase in molecular weight, cross-sectional area, and hydrophobicity and decrease in solubility and pKa. Additionally, for the four tested chlorophenols, it seems that the magnitude of adsorption is directly proportional to their degree of chlorination. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, due to slow growth, screening of mutant libraries using microtiter plates is not feasible. Results: We present a method for high-throughput, single-cell analysis and sorting of genetically engineered l-lactate-producing strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. A microfluidic device is used to encapsulate single cells in picoliter droplets, assay the droplets for l-lactate production, and sort strains with high productivity. We demonstrate the separation of low- and high-producing reference strains, as well as enrichment of a more productive l-lactate-synthesizing population after UV-induced mutagenesis. The droplet platform also revealed population heterogeneity in photosynthetic growth and lactate production, as well as the presence of metabolically stalled cells. Conclusions: The workflow will facilitate metabolic engineering and directed evolution studies and will be useful in studies of cyanobacteria biochemistry and physiology.},

A bench-top rapid prototyping method is outlined to allow the user to design and fabricate the coated slides using only tape and hydrophobic spray. The rapid prototyping method is compatible with microwell arrays, allowing soluble gradients to be applied to cells in shear-protected microwells. The method's simplicity makes it accessible to virtually any researcher or student and its use of passive mechanisms makes it ideal for field use and compatible with point-of-care and global health initiatives.},

Localized interactions within these assemblages are predicted to affect the coexistence of the component species, community structure and function, but there have been few explicit empirical analyses of the evolution of interactions. Here we show, with the use of a two-species community, that selection in a spatially structured environment leads to the evolution of an exploitative interaction. Simple mutations in the genome of one species caused it to adapt to the presence of the other, forming an intimate and specialized association. The derived community was more stable and more productive than the ancestral community. Our results show that evolution in a spatially structured environment can stabilize interactions between species, provoke marked changes in their symbiotic nature and affect community function.},

The complexity of this natural parameter space has made characterization of the key drivers of community development difficult. In order to facilitate these characterizations, we have developed a microwell platform designed to screen microbial growth and interactions across a wide variety of physical and initial conditions. Assembly of microbial communities into microwells was achieved using a novel biofabrication method that exploits well feature sizes for control of innoculum levels. Wells with incrementally smaller size features created populations with increasingly larger variations in inoculum levels. This allowed for reproducible growth measurement in large (20 μm diameter) wells, and screening for favorable growth conditions in small (5, 10 μm diameter) wells. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for screening and discovery using 5 μm wells to assemble P. aeruginosa colonies across a broad distribution of innoculum levels, and identify those conditions that promote the highest probability of survivial and growth under spatial confinement. Multimember community assembly was also characterized to demonstrate the broad potential of this platform for studying the role of member abundance on microbial competition, mutualism and community succession.},

  abstract = {Foodborne contamination and associated illness in the United States is responsible for an estimated 48 million cases per year. Increased food demand, global commerce of perishable foods, and the growing threat of antibiotic resistance are driving factors elevating concern for food safety. Foodborne illness is often associated with fresh-cut, ready-to-eat produce commodities due to the perishable nature of the product and relatively minimal processing from farm to the consumer. The research presented here optimizes and evaluates the utility of microfluidic droplets, also termed ultra-miniaturized bioreactors, for rapid detection of viable Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium in a shredded lettuce wash water acquired from a major Mid-Atlantic produce processing facility (denoted as Producer) in the U.S. Using a fluorescently-labeled anti-S. Typhimurium antibody and relative fluorescence intensities, paired with in-droplet incubation, S. Typhimurium was detected and identified with 100\% specificity in less than 5 h. In initial optimization experiments using S. Typhimurium- spiked sterile water, the relative fluorescence intensity of S. Typhimurium was approximately two times that of the observed relative intensities of five non-S. Typhimurium negative controls at 4-h incubation in droplets containing Rappaport-Vasiliadis (RV) broth at 37°C: relative fluorescence intensity for S. Typhimurium = 2.36 (95\% CI: 2.15-2.58), Enterobacter aerogens 1.12 (95\% CI: 1.09-1.16), Escherichia coli 700609 = 1.13 (95\% CI: 1.09-1.17), E. coli 13706 1.13 (95\% CI: 1.07-1.19), E. coli 700891 1.05 (95\% CI: 1.03-1.07) and Citrobacter freundii 1.04 (95\% CI: 1.03-1.05). S. Typhimurium- and E. aerogens-spiked shredded lettuce wash waters acquired from the Producer were then incubated 4 h in-droplet at 37°C with RV broth. The observed relative fluorescence of S. Typhimurium was significantly higher than that of E. aerogens, 1.56 (95\% CI: 1.42-1.71) and 1.10 (95\% CI: 1.08-1.12), respectively. While further optimization focusing on compatible concentration methodologies for highly-dilute produce water samples is needed, this application of droplet microfluidics shows great promise in dramatically shortening the time necessary.from days to hours.to confirm viable bacterial contamination in ready-to-eat produce wash waters used throughout the domestic and international food industry.},

Applicability of the techniques to large scale operation is discussed. Modification of existing processes is suggested for the reduction of energy requirements and improved process economics. The requirements for the liberation of granular intracellular products such as inclusion bodies and virus-like yeast particles are distinguished from those for the liberation of soluble products, mainly proteinaceous in nature. The integrated nature of the process with both upstream and downstream processes is addressed. Finally, the recent approach of selective liberation of soluble products of interest is reviewed. © 1991.},

  abstract = {The structure and diffusion properties of composite particles consisting of a calcium alginate hydrogel core and a thin SiO(2) surface layer have been investigated. The composite particles were formed by depositing a silica layer onto calcium alginate cores using a sol-gel process starting from alkoxysilane precursors. The composite particles were found to have a remarkable ability to reversibly rehydrate and return to their original size and shape after partial drying. The organo-silica skin was able to sustain large local deformations (such as complete folding) without the formation of cracks or defects. Such mechanical properties are uncharacteristic of pure silica and they can be attributed to the specific microstructure of the alginate-silica composite. The structure and composition of the alginate-silica particles were characterised by SEM, X-ray micro-tomography, Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy and Thermo-gravimetry. In order to quantify the effect of the organo-silica layer on the diffusional transport into and out of the alginate particles, the uptake and release rates of several test molecules with increasing molecular weight were measured for both un-coated and silica-coated particles. While the diffusion rate of small and medium-size molecules (water, vitamin B12) was essentially unaffected by the presence of the silica layer, the diffusion rate of a larger biomolecule (lysozyme) was found to be slowed down by the presence of the surface layer. The flexibility of the organo-silica layer combined with the ability of even large biomolecules to diffuse through it indicate that the silica layer is macroporous, formed by individual SiO(2) nanoparticles dispersed and immobilised in the surface layer of the alginate hydrogel.},

QS allows bacteria to behave as a cohesive group and coordinate collective behaviors. While most QS receptors display high specificity to their AI ligands, others are quite promiscuous in signal detection. How do specific QS receptors respond to their cognate signals with high fidelity? Why do some receptors maintain low signal recognition specificity? In addition, many QS systems are composed of multiple intersecting signaling pathways: what are the benefits of preserving such a complex signaling network when a simple linear 'one-to-one' regulatory pathway seems sufficient to monitor cell density? Here, we will discuss different molecular mechanisms employed by various QS systems that ensure productive and specific QS responses. Moreover, the network architectures of some well-characterized QS circuits will be reviewed to understand how the wiring of different regulatory components achieves different biological goals.},

  abstract = {Symbioses provide a way to surpass the limitations of individual microbes. Natural communities exemplify this in symbioses like lichens and biofilms that are robust to perturbations, an essential feature in fluctuating environments. Metabolic capabilities also expand in consortia enabling the division of labor across organisms as seen in photosynthetic and methanogenic communities. In engineered consortia, the external environment provides levers of control for microbes repurposed from nature or engineered to interact through synthetic biology. Consortia have successfully been applied to real-world problems including remediation and energy, however there are still fundamental questions to be answered. It is clear that continued study is necessary for the understanding and engineering of microbial systems that are more than the sum of their parts.},

In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803), the thylakoids are arranged parallel to the plasma membrane and occasionally converge toward it to form biogenesis centers. The initial steps in PSII assembly are thought to take place in these regions, which contain a membrane subcompartment harboring the early assembly factor PratA and are referred to as PratA-defined membranes (PDMs). Loss of CurT, the Synechocystis 6803 homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana grana-shaping proteins of the CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 family, results in disrupted thylakoid organization and the absence of biogenesis centers. As a consequence, PSII is less efficiently assembled and accumulates to only 50\% of wild-type levels. CurT induces membrane curvature in vitro and is distributed all over the thylakoids, with local concentrations at biogenesis centers. There it forms a sophisticated tubular network at the cell periphery, as revealed by live-cell imaging. CurT is part of several high molecular mass complexes, and Blue Native/SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing demonstrated that different isoforms associate with PDMs and thylakoids. Moreover, CurT deficiency enhances sensitivity to osmotic stress, adding a level of complexity to CurT function. We propose that CurT is crucial for the differentiation of membrane architecture, including the formation of PSIIrelated biogenesis centers, in Synechocystis 6803.},

Cellular reactions at the membrane level to the toxicities of both compounds were different. In growing cells of P. putida S12, sublethal concentrations of toluene resulted in an increase in the degree of saturation of the membrane fatty acids, whereas toxically equivalent concentrations of ethanol led to a decrease in this value. Contrary to this, cells also reacted to both substances with a strong increase of the trans unsaturated fatty acids and a corresponding decrease of the cis unsaturated fatty acids under conditions where growth and other cellular membrane reactions were totally inhibited. While the isomerization of cis to trans unsaturated fatty acids compensates for the fluidizing effect caused by ethanol, a decrease in the degree of saturation is antagonistic with respect to the chemo-physical properties of the membrane. Consequently, the results support the hypothesis that the decrease in the degree of saturation induced by ethanol is not an adaptation mechanism but is caused by an inhibitory effect of the compound on the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids.},

An intact outer membrane is a permeability barrier, and excludes hydrophobic substances such as NPN but, once damaged, it can allow the entry of NPN to the phospholipid layer, resulting in prominent fluorescence. With Escherichia coli O157, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium as test organisms and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium hexametaphosphate as the model permeabilizers, quantitative and highly reproducible NPN uptake levels were obtained that differed characteristically between the test bacteria. Furthermore, citric acid was shown to be a potent permeabilizer at millimolar concentrations, its effect being partly (Ps. aeruginosa, Salm. typhimurium) or almost totally (E. coli O157) abolished by MgCl2, suggesting that part of the action occurs by chelation. Sodium citrate induced weak NPN uptake, which was totally abolished by MgCl2. In conclusion, the NPN uptake assay with the automated spectrofluorometer serves as a convenient method in analysing and quantifying the effects of external agents, including potential food preservatives, on Gram-negative bacteria.},

Chitosan (250 ppm) at pH 5.3 induced significant uptake of the hydrophobic probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. The effect was reduced (E. coli, salmonellae) or abolished (P. aeruginosa) by MgCl2. No NPN uptake was observed during exposure of the salmonellae to chitosan at pH 7.2. Chitosan also sensitized P. aeruginosa and the salmonellae to the lytic effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); such sensitization was not blocked by MgCl2 and was reversible by washing chitosan-treated cells prior to SDS exposure. Chemical and electrophoretic analyses of cell-free supernatants of chitosan-treated cell suspensions showed that interaction of chitosan with E. coli and the salmonellae involved no release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other membrane lipids. However, chitosan rendered E. coli more sensitive to the inhibitory action of dyes and bile acids used in selective media. Highly cationic mutants of S. typhimurium were more resistant to chitosan than the parent strains. Electron microscopy showed that chitosan caused extensive cell surface alterations and covered the OM with vesicular structures. Chitosan thus appeared to bind to the outer membrane, explaining the loss of the barrier function. This property makes chitosan a potentially useful indirect antimicrobial for food protection.

  abstract = {It has been suggested that ethanol metabolism in the strict anaerobe Clostridium kluyveri occurs within a metabolosome, a subcellular proteinaceous bacterial microcompartment. Two bacterial microcompartment shell proteins [EtuA (ethanol utilization shell protein A) and EtuB] are found encoded on the genome clustered with the genes for ethanol utilization. The function of the bacterial microcompartment is to facilitate fermentation by sequestering the enzymes, substrates and intermediates. Recent structural studies of bacterial microcompartment proteins have revealed both hexamers and pentamers that assemble to generate the pseudo-icosahedral bacterial microcompartment shell. Some of these shell proteins have pores on their symmetry axes. Here we report the structure of the trimeric bacterial microcompartment protein EtuB, which has a tandem structural repeat within the subunit and pseudo-hexagonal symmetry. The pores in the EtuB trimer are within the subunits rather than between symmetry related subunits. We suggest that the evolutionary advantage of this is that it releases the pore from the rotational symmetry constraint allowing more precise control of the fluxes of asymmetric molecules, such as ethanol, across the pore. We also model EtuA and demonstrate that the two proteins have the potential to interact to generate the casing for a metabolosome.},

  abstract = {A new form of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) called thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis (TMFA) is introduced with the capability of generating thermodynamically feasible flux and metabolite activity profiles on a genome scale. TMFA involves the use of a set of linear thermodynamic constraints in addition to the mass balance constraints typically used in MFA. TMFA produces flux distributions that do not contain any thermodynamically infeasible reactions or pathways, and it provides information about the free energy change of reactions and the range of metabolite activities in addition to reaction fluxes. TMFA is applied to study the thermodynamically feasible ranges for the fluxes and the Gibbs free energy change, ΔrG′, of the reactions and the activities of the metabolites in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli developed by Palsson and co-workers. In the TMFA of the genome scale model, the metabolite activities and reaction ΔrG′ are able to achieve a wide range of values at optimal growth. The reaction dihydroorotase is identified as a possible thermodynamic bottleneck in E. coli metabolism with a Δ rG′ constrained close to zero while numerous reactions are identified throughout metabolism for which ΔrG′ is always highly negative regardless of metabolite concentrations. As it has been proposed previously, these reactions with exclusively negative ΔrG′ might be candidates for cell regulation, and we find that a significant number of these reactions appear to be the first steps in the linear portion of numerous biosynthesis pathways. The thermodynamically feasible ranges for the concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H, and H extracellular+/Hintracellular+ are also determined and found to encompass the values observed experimentally in every case. Further, we find that the NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH ratios maintained in the cell are close to the minimum feasible ratio and maximum feasible ratio, respectively. © 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

Positive results were obtained for DMSO solutions of all four diisocyanates in the presence of S9 mix containing 30\% S9 fraction. Uniformly negative results were found when the diisocyanates were dissolved in EDGE. These results correspond to those of analytical investigations. A small amount of diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA) is one of the reaction products formed when MDI is dissolved in commercial DMSO. No MDA could be detected in solutions of MDI in EGDE. It is therefore concluded that the positive results obtained with diisocyanates in DMSO solutions are due to the formation of MDA. This is artificially formed through the hydrolysis of MDI, caused by traces of water that are always present in DMSO. These findings indicate that DMSO is an inappropriate solvent and should therefore not be used in any in vitro study with diisocyanates. EGDE may be a suitable replacement. The positive test results reported so far for DMSO solutions of MDI are thus only of limited relevance for risk evaluation.},

Due to the pore size, hydrogels allow nutrients and waste to pass through while preventing invading microorganisms from entering the microfiber. Experimental cultivation shows the growth of target bacteria inside the alginate hydrogel microfiber during exposure to invading bacteria. The membrane thickness of the microfiber greatly affects the bacterial growth due to changes in membrane permeability. The enhancement of mechanical toughness is also demonstrated by employing a double-network hydrogel for long-term cultivation. The hollow hydrogel microfiber has the potential to become a mainstream solution for mass-cultivation of microorganisms in an open system.},

  abstract = {Encapsulated cells were formed from the assembly of cationic and anionic alternating layers using a number of polyelectrolyte-based systems. Chitosan, alginate, hyaluronic acid, and oligonucleotides were used as polyelectrolytes to encapsulate individual E. coli cells, which were used as a model. Zeta potential measurements taken for both chitosan/alginate and chitosan/hyaluronic acid systems indicate successful layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition and gave full reversal of the surface change eight times. Layer adsorption was further observed by fluorescence microscopy, and, through a newly developed protocol for sample preparation, transmission electron microscopy micrographs clearly showed the presence of LbL assembly on the outer layer of the cell membrane, in the nanometer range. A second generation of E. coli cells could be grown from encapsulated first generation cells, demonstrating that the cellular activity was not affected by the presence of polyelectrolyte multilayers. Hybridization between attached oligonucleotide sequences and the complementary sequence was demonstrated by both fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Fluorescence energy transfer data recorded after hybrid formation showed that at a molar ratio of 10:20 (donor:acceptor), Q and I were 92.3\% and 52.5\%, respectively, which suggests that fluorescein fluorescence was quenched by 92.3\% and that the fluorescence of rhodamine was enhanced by 52.5\%. Oligonucleotide incorporation was stabilized by deposition of four alternating layers, hence offering not only the potential use of the encapsulated cell as a bio-recognition system but also its application in a number of fields such as oligonucleotide delivery, gene therapy, and the use of DNA as an immunocompatible coating.},

Previously, we have succeeded in producing isopropanol from cellular acetyl-CoA by means of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 into which a synthetic metabolic pathway was introduced. The isopropanol production by this synthetic metabolic pathway requires acetate; therefore, the cells grown under photosynthetic conditions have to be transferred to a dark and anaerobic conditions~to produce acetate. In this study, we achieved acetate production under photosynthetic conditions by S.~elongatus PCC 7942 into which we introduced the pta gene encoding phosphate acetyltransferase from Escherichia coli. The metabolic modification (via pta introduction) of the isopropanol-producing strain enabled production of isopropanol under photosynthetic conditions. During 14 days of production, the titer of isopropanol reached 0.55~mM (33.1~mg/l) with an intermediate product, acetone, at 0.21~mM (12.2~mg/l).},

  abstract = {Biofilms dominate microbial life in numerous aquatic ecosystems, and in engineered and medical systems, as well. The formation of biofilms is initiated by single primary cells colonizing surfaces from the bulk liquid. The next steps from primary cells towards the first cell clusters as the initial step of biofilm formation remain relatively poorly studied. Clonal growth and random migration of primary cells are traditionally considered as the dominant processes leading to organized microcolonies in laboratory grown monocultures. Using Voronoi tessellation, we show that the spatial distribution of primary cells colonizing initially sterile surfaces from natural streamwater community deviates from uniform randomness already during the very early colonisation. The deviation from uniform randomness increased with colonisation - despite the absence of cell reproduction - and was even more pronounced when the flow of water above biofilms was multidirectional and shear stress elevated. We propose a simple mechanistic model that captures interactions, such as cell-to-cell signalling or chemical surface conditioning, to simulate the observed distribution patterns. Model predictions match empirical observations reasonably well, highlighting the role of biotic interactions even already during very early biofilm formation despite few and distant cells. The transition from single primary cells to clustering accelerated by biotic interactions rather than by reproduction may be particularly advantageous in harsh environments - the rule rather than the exception outside the laboratory. © 2011 Hödl et al.},

The scaling law is valid for polymer solutions for which electrohydrodynamic atomization produces pure droplets (no fibers) that do not undergo multiple explosions or give rise to coalescing particles upon collection. Electrohydrodynamic atomization can be used to produce not only controlled size polymer particles but also particles with controlled physical properties.

Although numerous theoretical studies suggest that spatial structure is critical for cooperation to persist, the spatial ecology of microbial cooperation remains largely unexplored experimentally. By tracking the community dynamics of cooperating (rpoS wild-type) and cheating (rpoS mutant) Escherichia coli in well-mixed flasks and microfabricated habitats, we demonstrate that spatial structure stabilizes coexistence between wild-type and mutant and thus facilitates cooperator maintenance. We develop a method to interpret our experimental results in the context of game theory, and show that the game wild-type and mutant bacteria play in an unstructured environment changes markedly over time, and eventually obeys a prisoner's dilemma leading to cheater dominance. In contrast, when wild-type and mutant E. coli co-inhabit a spatially-structured habitat, cooperators and cheaters coexist at intermediate frequencies. Our findings show that even in microhabitats lacking patchiness or spatial heterogeneities in resource availability, surface growth allows cells to form multi-cellular aggregates, yielding a self-structured community in which cooperators persist.},

Polycationic polymers poly-L-lysine (PLL), polyethylenimine (PEI), and diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-DEX) and sphere-like poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are employed because of their importance for gene and drug delivery. AFM studies indicate that all the polycationic polymers cause the formation and/or expansion of preexisting defects in supported DMPC bilayers in the concentration range of 1-3 microg/mL. By way of contrast, hydroxyl-containing neutral linear poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) do not induce hole formation or expand the size of preexisting defects in the same concentration range. All polymers tested are not toxic to KB or Rat2 cells up to a 12 microg/mL concentration (XTT assay). In the concentration range of 6-12 microg/mL, however, significant amounts of the cytosolic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and luciferase (LUC) are released. PEI, which possesses the greatest density of charged groups on its chain, shows the most dramatic increase in membrane permeability. In addition, treatment with polycationic polymers allows the small dye molecules propidium idodide (PI) and fluorescein (FITC) to diffuse in and out of the cells. CLSM images also show internalization of PLL labeled with FITC dye. In contrast, controls of membrane permeability using the neutral linear polymers PEG and PVA show dramatically less LDH and LUC leakage and no enhanced dye diffusion. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that polycationic polymers induce the formation of transient, nanoscale holes in living cells and that these holes allow a greatly enhanced exchange of materials across the cell membrane.},

These microparticles can be facilely synthesized by electrospraying a RIF/PLGA solution using a cone-jet mode, and then the sprayed microparticles go through a size separation process during which microparticles move to a collector to obtain desirable quasi-monodisperse microparticles. Experiment shows that the microparticle size can be well controlled by the jet flow rate, following the scaling laws of electrospray. The microparticle morphologies demonstrated are closely related to the drug loading quantity. A low drug loading produces the microparticles with spherical shape. With an increase of drug loading, wrinkled microparticles emerge. The drug release results indicate that drug release profiles are closely related to the microparticle diameter and drug loading. The concentration gradient of RIF in the particle matrix decreases outwards from some position as the microparticle diameter increases but rises with the increase of RIF loading. The as-sprayed quasi-monodisperse aerosol particles with mean diameters in the range of 2 - 5 ?? m have potential application for pulmonary drug delivery. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Synthetic microbial consortia consisting of microorganisms with different synthetic genetic circuits or divided synthetic metabolic pathway components can exert functions that are beyond the capacities of single microorganisms. However, few consortia of microorganisms with different synthetic genetic circuits have been developed. We designed and constructed a synthetic microbial consortium composed of an enzyme-producing strain and a target chemical-producing strain using Escherichia coli for chemical production with efficient saccharification. The enzyme-producing strain harbored a synthetic genetic circuit to produce beta-glucosidase, which converts cellobiose to glucose, destroys itself via the lytic genes, and release the enzyme when the desired cell density is reached. The target chemical-producing strain was programmed by a synthetic genetic circuit to express enzymes in the synthetic metabolic pathway for isopropanol production when the enzyme-producing strain grows until release of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate the benefits of synthetic microbial consortia with distributed tasks for effective chemical production from biomass.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for locating protein anti-genic determinants by analyzing amino acid sequences in order to find the point of greatest local hydrophilicity. This is accom-plished by assigning each amino acid a numerical value (hydro-philicity value) and then repetitively averaging these values along the peptide chain. The point ofhighest local average hydrophilicity is invariably located in, or immediately adjacent to, an antigenic determinant. It was found that the prediction success rate de-pended on averaging group length, with hexapeptide averages yielding optimal results. The method was developed using 12 pro-teins for which extensive immunochemical analysis has been car-ried out and subsequently was used to predict antigenic deter-minants for the following proteins: hepatitis B surface antigen, influenza hemagglutinins, fowl plague virus hemagglutinin, hu-man histocompatibility antigen HLA-B7, human interferons, Escherichia coli and cholera enterotoxins, ragweed allergens Ra3 and Ra5, and streptococcal M protein. The hepatitis B surface antigen sequence was synthesized by chemical means and was shown to have antigenic activity by radioimmunoassay. The elucidation of protein antigenic structures is presently a difficult, uncertain, and time-consuming task. To precisely de-lineate antigenic determinants, it is necessary to prepare a large number ofwell-characterized chemical derivatives and peptide fragments from the original protein antigen and then to test these derivatives for immunological activity (1, 2). Alterna-tively, a homologous series of proteins may be used to assess the influence ofparticular amino acid substitutions, thereby im-plicating certain regions as antigenic determinants (3, 4); this approach requires knowledge of complete primary structures for a number of proteins before the immunological results can be interpreted. Despite the laboriousness of available ap-proaches, the complete antigenic structures have been eluci-dated for a small number of proteins, and partial information is available for many others. As more information becomes available on protein antigens, it should be possible to use this information to predict the lo-cations of antigenic determinants before any immunological testing has been carried out. In recent years a number of sys-tems have been developed to predict protein conformational features from amino acid sequences (5-8), but none of these were specifically oriented to the prediction of antigenic deter-minants. Therefore, we sought a method that was not predi-cated upon predictions of particular structural features but rather sought a simple correlation with surface location of stretches of peptide chain and the likelihood of antibody bind-ing. A guiding principle was the notion that many surface ori-ented regions are nonantigenic (1). This led us to take an em-pirical approach in our analysis and to arbitrarily manipulate the emphasis placed on certain amino acids in order to find a},

Fluorescence microscopy coupled to computer vision techniques were used to rapidly determine the absolute abundance of each strain in hundreds to thousands of droplets per condition. We showed that MINI-Drop could accurately infer pairwise and higher-order interactions in synthetic consortia. We developed a stochastic model of community assembly to provide insight into the heterogeneity in community states across droplets. Finally, we elucidated the complex web of interactions linking antibiotics and different species in a synthetic consortium. In sum, we demonstrated a robust and generalizable method to infer microbial interaction networks by random encapsulation of sub-communities into microfluidic droplets.},

  abstract = {Background: Cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 holds promise for biochemical conversion, but gene deletion in PCC 7942 is time-consuming and may be lethal to cells. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is an emerging technology that exploits the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to repress sequence-specific genes without the need of gene knockout, and is repurposed to rewire metabolic networks in various procaryotic cells. Results: To employ CRISPRi for the manipulation of gene network in PCC 7942, we integrated the cassettes expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), dCas9 and sgRNA targeting different regions on eyfp into the PCC 7942 chromosome. Co-expression of dCas9 and sgRNA conferred effective and stable suppression of EYFP production at efficiencies exceeding 99\%, without impairing cell growth. We next integrated the dCas9 and sgRNA targeting endogenous genes essential for glycogen accumulation (glgc) and succinate conversion to fumarate (sdhA and sdhB). Transcription levels of glgc, sdhA and sdhB were effectively suppressed with efficiencies depending on the sgRNA binding site. Targeted suppression of glgc reduced the expression to 6.2\%, attenuated the glycogen accumulation to 4.8\% and significantly enhanced the succinate titer. Targeting sdhA or sdhB also effectively downregulated the gene expression and enhanced the succinate titer ≈12.5-fold to ≈0.58-0.63 mg/L. Conclusions: These data demonstrated that CRISPRi-mediated gene suppression allowed for re-directing the cellular carbon flow, thus paving a new avenue to rationally fine-tune the metabolic pathways in PCC 7942 for the production of biotechnological products.},

Synthetic bistable switches in prokaryotes have mainly utilized transcriptional components in their construction. Using both transcriptional and enzymatic components, creating a hybrid system, allows for wider bistable parameter ranges in a circuit.Results: In this paper, we demonstrate a tunable family of hybrid bistable switches in E. coli using both transcriptional components and an enzymatic component. The design contains two linked positive feedback loops. The first loop utilizes the lambda repressor, CI, and the second positive feedback loop incorporates the Lon protease found in Mesoplasma florum (mf-Lon). We experimentally tested for bistable behavior in exponential growth phase, and found that our hybrid bistable switch was able to retain its state in the absence of an input signal throughout 40 cycles of cell division. We also tested the transient behavior of our switch and found that switching speeds can be tuned by changing the expression rate of mf-Lon.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this work demonstrates the first use of dynamic expression of an orthogonal and heterologous protease to tune a nonlinear protein degradation circuit. The hybrid switch is potentially a more robust and tunable topology for use in prokaryotic systems. © 2012 Huang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In cyanobacteria, Rubisco enzymes are densely packed and encapsulated in a specialized organelle known as the carboxysome. Well-defined Rubisco assembly and carboxysome formation are pivotal for efficient CO 2 fixation. Numerous chaperone proteins, including RbcX, are essential for proper protein folding and Rubisco assembly. In this study, we investigated the in vivo function of RbcX in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Syn7942) using molecular, biochemical, and live-cell fluorescence imaging approaches. Our results show that genetic deletion of the rbcX gene affects Rubisco abundance, as well as carboxysome formation and spatial distribution. Moreover, RbcX appears as one component of the carboxysome and shows a dynamic interaction with Rubisco enzymes. These in vivo observations provide insight into the role of RbcX from Syn7942 in mediating carboxysome assembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying Rubisco assembly and carboxysome biogenesis will provide essential information required for engineering functional CO 2 -fixing complexes in heterogeneous organisms, especially plants, with the aim of boosting photosynthesis and agricultural productivity.},

  abstract = {Carboxysomes are membrane-free organelles for carbon assimilation in cyanobacteria. The carboxysome consists of a proteinaceous shell that structurally resembles virus capsids and internal enzymes including ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), the primary carbon-fixing enzyme in photosynthesis. The formation of carboxysomes requires hierarchical self-assembly of thousands of protein subunits, initiated from Rubisco assembly and packaging to shell encapsulation. Here we study the role of Rubisco assembly factor 1 (Raf1) in Rubisco assembly and carboxysome formation in a model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (Syn7942). Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that Raf1 facilitates Rubisco assembly by mediating RbcL dimer formation and dimer–dimer interactions. Syn7942 cells lacking Raf1 are unable to form canonical intact carboxysomes but generate a large number of intermediate assemblies comprising Rubisco, CcaA, CcmM, and CcmN without shell encapsulation and a low abundance of carboxysome-like structures with reduced dimensions and irregular shell shapes and internal organization. As a consequence, the Raf1-depleted cells exhibit reduced Rubisco content, CO 2 -fixing activity, and cell growth. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone-assisted Rubisco assembly and biogenesis of carboxysomes. Advanced understanding of the biogenesis and stepwise formation process of the biogeochemically important organelle may inform strategies for heterologous engineering of functional CO 2 -fixing modules to improve photosynthesis.},

Experimental results are given for a single-solute system containing phenol and a bisolute system containing phenol and p-cresol, both of which were regenerated using a mono-culture of Pseudomonas putida. The performance of an activated carbon adsorber that was bioregenerated up to six times was evaluated on the basis of the breakthough of phenolics during each intervening continuous-flow adsorption period. For both the regeneration and the loading cycles, predictions of system behaviour based on the bioregeneration model of Hutchinson and Robins??n (1990) agreed well with experimental observations. Carbon particle internal diffusional resistances were found to be rate limiting during most of the regeneration cycle. The breakthough performance of the bioregenerated carbon was found to deteriorate with each successive regeneration. Microbial fouling of the column during bioregeneration was found to produce a marked deterioration in the subsequent breakthrough performance of the bioregenerated activated carbon. ?? 1990.},

  abstract = {A simple strategy for enhancing the Raman spectral selectivity of complex mixture samples by measuring them in a frozen state at low temperatures has been demonstrated and proven to improve the accuracy for compositional analysis. For evaluation, the Raman spectra of synthetic hydrocarbon mixtures that were composed of eleven hydrocarbons (n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, isooctane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and indan) were continuously collected during the elevation of their temperature from cryogenic to near room temperature. The accuracy of determination of n-paraffin concentrations improved significantly when the samples were measured at the temperature range between approximately -175 and -155 °C in comparison to the measurements at room temperature. However, the improvement of accuracy was relatively marginal for the concentration determination of naphthenic and aromatic components. Since n-paraffins are easily compressible and deformable in frozen conditions, the subsequent spectral variations could be diverse depending on their molecular structures. Due to this fact, the spectral discrimination among the paraffin components, as well as in comparison to other components, was enhanced and the improved spectral selectivity eventually led to more accurate determination of concentrations. Overall, the proposed strategy is simple and effective, so it is applicable for analysis of real complex mixture samples.},

Despite the progress made in developing and optimizing computational modeling parameters to recapitulate these interactions in silico, experimental verification of model predictions in vitro is often elusive, due to the limits of common laboratory culturing methods, especially at the micro- and nanoscale. In this work, micro-scale bioprinting was used to evaluate the spatiotemporal effects of metabolite sharing between partners in an artificial syntrophic consortium consisting of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Micro-colonies of these bacteria were patterned at increasing spatial separation distances, in the presence of competitor or cooperator strains. Growth of the consortium members was evaluated and compared to predictions generated by a bacterial growth modeling platform known as Computation of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space (COMETS). In close agreement with simulation, experimental metabolite sharing between micro-colonies exhibited strong distance-dependency. When bioprinted micro-colonies were confronted with one-way or two-way diffusion barriers, such as the intervention of cooperative or competitive bacteria, experimental results showed that spatial positioning of the barriers critically influences metabolite sharing between consortium members. These results were generally predicted by simulation in COMETS. Our results demonstrate the utility of micro-scale bioprinting to experimentally test which aspects of predictive microbial growth models hold at this spatial scale, and for a range of synthetic biology applications.},

  abstract = {Carboxysomes are polyhedral inclusion bodies that play a key role in autotrophic metabolism in many bacteria. Using electron cryotomography, we examined carboxysomes in their native states within intact cells of three chemolithoautotrophic bacteria. We found that carboxysomes generally cluster into distinct groups within the cytoplasm, often in the immediate vicinity of polyphosphate granules, and a regular lattice of density frequently connects granules to nearby carboxysomes. Small granular bodies were also seen within carboxysomes. These observations suggest a functional relationship between carboxysomes and polyphosphate granules. Carboxysomes exhibited greater size, shape, and compositional variability in cells than in purified preparations. Finally, we observed carboxysomes in various stages of assembly, as well as filamentous structures that we attribute to misassembled shell protein. Surprisingly, no more than one partial carboxysome was ever observed per cell. Based on these observations, we propose a model for carboxysome assembly in which the shell and the internal RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) lattice form simultaneously, likely guided by specific interactions between shell proteins and RuBisCOs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The term immobilized enzymes refers to "enzymes physically confined or localized in a certain defined region of space with retention of their catalytic activities, and which can be used repeatedly and continuously."Immobilized enzymes are currently the subject of considerable interest because of their advantages over soluble enzymes. In addition to their use in industrial processes, the immobilization techniques are the basis for making a number of biotechnology products with application in diagnostics, bioaffinity chromatography, and biosensors. At the beginning, only immobilized single enzymes were used, after 1970s more complex systems including two-enzyme reactions with cofactor regeneration and living cells were developed.The enzymes can be attached to the support by interactions ranging from reversible physical adsorption and ionic linkages to stable covalent bonds. Although the choice of the most appropriate immobilization technique depends on the nature of the enzyme and the carrier, in the last years the immobilization technology has increasingly become a matter of rational design.As a consequence of enzyme immobilization, some properties such as catalytic activity or thermal stability become altered. These effects have been demonstrated and exploited. The concept of stabilization has been an important driving force for immobilizing enzymes. Moreover, true stabilization at the molecular level has been demonstrated, e.g., proteins immobilized through multipoint covalent binding.},

Contact printing can be used to create dense arrays of viable microorganisms. Such "living arrays", potentially with multiple identical replicates, are useful in the selection of improved industrial microorganisms, screening antimicrobials, clinical diagnostics, strain storage, and for research into microbial genetics. A high throughput method to print microorganisms at high density was devised, employing a microscope and a stamp with a massive array of PDMS pins. Viable bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Esherichia coli), yeast (Candida albicans) and fungal spores (Aspergillus fumigatus) were deposited onto porous aluminium oxide (PAO) using arrays of pins with areas from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20 microm. Printing onto PAO with up to 8100 pins of 20 x 20 microm area with 3 replicates was achieved. Printing with up to 200 pins onto PAO culture chips (divided into 40 x 40 microm culture areas) allowed inoculation followed by effective segregation of microcolonies during outgrowth. Additionally, it was possible to print mixtures of C. albicans and spores of A. fumigatus with a degree of selectivity by capture onto a chemically modified PAO surface. High resolution printing of microorganisms within segregated compartments and on functionalized PAO surfaces has significant advantages over what is possible on semi-solid surfaces such as agar.},

PEMs composed of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) polyelectrolyte pairs and of poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and PSS were built up to 17 layers. The combination of ellipsometry and QCM-D allowed simultaneous determination of the acoustic mass, which comprises both the mass of the polymer and solvent, and the optical mass which corresponds to the polymer mass alone. From these parameters, the hydration of the PEM was calculated layer by layer. The linearly growing PAH/PSS PEMs showed a constant absolute content of water throughout the assembly, while the relative contribution of water to the PEM mass content approached zero, when grown in 0.5 M NaCl. Rinses with water between polyelectrolyte deposition steps resulted in a hydration of approximately 40\%. The supralinearly growing PDADMAC/PSS PEMs exhibited a remarkable dependence of the hydration on the polyelectrolyte that was deposited last. Implications for the mechanism of assembly of the PEMs are discussed.},

Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but are surrounded by layers of peptidoglycan many times thicker than is found in the gram-negatives. Threading through these layers of peptidoglycan are long anionic polymers, called teichoic acids.

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria must balance separate demands for energy generation, carbon assimilation, and biomass synthesis. We used shotgun proteomics to investigate proteome allocation strategies in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as it adapted to light and inorganic carbon (Ci) limitation. When partitioning the proteome into seven functional sectors, we find that sector sizes change linearly with growth rate. The sector encompassing ribosomes is significantly smaller than in E. coli, which may explain the lower maximum growth rate in Synechocystis. Limitation of light dramatically affects multiple proteome sectors, whereas the effect of Ci limitation is weak. Carbon assimilation proteins respond more strongly to changes in light intensity than to Ci. A coarse-grained cell economy model generally explains proteome trends. However, deviations from model predictions suggest that the large proteome sectors for carbon and light assimilation are not optimally utilized under some growth conditions and may constrain the proteome space available to ribosomes. Jahn et al. used shotgun proteomics to investigate resource allocation strategies in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis as it adapted to light and carbon limitation. They found that cells reorganize their proteome following a growth optimization strategy but deviate from this strategy to keep protein reserves even under nutrient-replete conditions.},

During rescue, tmRNA acts first as a transfer RNA to bind stalled ribosomes, then as a messenger RNA to add the ssrA peptide tag to the C-terminus of the nascent polypeptide chain. The ssrA peptide targets tagged peptides for proteolysis, ensuring rapid degradation of potentially deleterious truncated polypeptides. Ribosome rescue also facilitates turnover of the damaged messages responsible for translational arrest. Thus, tmRNA increases the fidelity of gene expression by promoting the synthesis of full-length proteins. In addition to serving as a global quality control system, tmRNA also plays important roles in bacterial development, pathogenesis, and environmental stress responses. This review focuses on the mechanism of tmRNA-mediated ribosome rescue and the role of tmRNA in bacterial physiology. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The rates of hydrolysis of eight cephalosporins by intact and sonicated cells were measured, and the permeability coefficient (P) was calculated from these rates by the method of Zimmermann and Rosselet (W. Zimmermann and A. Rosselet, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 12:368-372, 1977). P ranged from (0.9 +/- 0.3) x 10(-8) (benzothienylcephalosporin) to (10 +/- 3.3) x 10(-8) cm/s (cephaloridine); i.e., the P values were lower than those reported for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli by 1 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively. The permeability barrier was shown to reduce drastically the stream of drug molecules entering the cell, allowing the rather low level of beta-lactamase (0.1 U/mg of protein with penicillin G) to decrease radically the concentration of the drug at the target; this explains the poor in vitro activities of the beta-lactams against M. chelonei. We also estimated P for small, hydrophilic molecules (glucose, glycerol, glycine, leucine), by studying their uptake kinetics. The values found, ranging from 15 x 10(-8) to 490 x 10(-8) cm/s, were consistent again with a very low permeability of M. chelonei cell wall. The permeation of cephalosporins was not very dependent on the hydrophobicity of the molecules or on the temperature, suggesting a hydrophilic pathway of penetration for these molecules.},

  abstract = {The development of template-synthesized silica nanotubes has created a unique opportunity for studying confined fluids by providing nanometer-scale containers in which the inner diameter (i.d.) and surface chemistry can be systematically and independently varied. An interesting question to be answered is the following: do solvents wet nanometer-scale tubes in the same way they wet ordinary capillaries? To answer this question, we have conducted studies to explore the wettability of the hydrophobic interiors of individual nanotubes. In these studies, single nanotubes with i.d.'s of either 30 or 170 nm were investigated over a range of water/methanol mixtures. These studies provide a direct route for comparing wetting phenomena in nanotubes with conventional macroscopic theories of capillarity. Our observations reveal four important aspects of capillary wetting in the 30-170 nm regime, a size range where the application of the Young-Laplace theory has not been experimentally investigated for hydrophobic pores. They are (i) a sharp transition between wetting and nonwetting conditions induced by addition of a cosolvent, (ii) invariance of this transition between nanotubes of 30 and 170 nm pore diameter, (iii) failure of the Young-Laplace equation to accurately predict the cosolvent's (methanol) mol fraction where the transition occurs, and (iv) reversibility of the observed wetting. The first two aspects conform to conventional capillarity (Young-Laplace), but the latter two do not. These measurements were complemented with ensemble experiments. The difference between theory and experiment is likely due to reliance on macroscopic values of contact angles or to liquid-phase instability within the hydrophobic pore.},

  abstract = {Communication between bacteria, belonging to the same species or to different species, is mediated through different chemical signals that are synthesized and secreted by bacteria. These signals can either be cell-density related (autoinducers) or be produced by bacteria at different stages of growth, and they allow bacteria to monitor their environment and alter gene expression to derive a competitive advantage. The properties of these signals and the response elicited by them are important in ensuring bacterial survival and propagation in natural environments (e.g., human oral cavity) where hundreds of bacterial species coexist. First, the interaction between a signal and its receptor is very specific, which underlies intraspecies communication and quorum sensing. Second, when multiple signals are synthesized by the same bacterium, the signaling circuits utilized by the different signals are coordinately regulated with distinct overall circuit architecture so as to maximize the overall response. Third, the recognition of a universal communication signal synthesized by different bacterial species (interspecies communication), as well that of signals produced by eukaryotic cells (interkingdom communication), is also integral to the formation of multispecies biofilm communities that are important in infection and disease. The focus of this review is on the principles underlying signal-mediated bacterial communication, with specific emphasis on the potential for using them in two applications-development of synthetic biology modules and circuits, and the control of biofilm formation and infection.},

In both of the above instances, the relics contained two distinct zones, an outer ring of ethylene glycol and a much smaller dense inner region of silica nanoparticles.

The technique of jet atomization employing electrohydrodynamics is a manifestation of electrospinning. However, we show for the first time that using this technique where individual droplets are generated, a continuous self-supporting submicrometer web-like structure can be grown whereby fragments of the structure are delivered in the droplets and polymerize on the surface of the growing structure via polycondensation. The development of these growing fibers into web structures is a direct result of the processing route together with the excellent tailor-made cross-linking nature of the resin. An operational map is generated to identify a parametric space in which the stable cone-jet mode of electrohydrodynamic atomization prevails for generating the finest droplets. A statistical analysis on the formed fibers for a given time and electrospray condition is presented together with optical micrographs of the structure, which concludes the discussion in this paper.},

  abstract = {Accurate predictive modelling of the growth of microbial communities requires the credible representation of the interactions of biological, chemical and mechanical processes. However, although biological and chemical processes are represented in a number of Individual-based Models (IbMs) the interaction of growth and mechanics is limited. Conversely, there are mechanically sophisticated IbMs with only elementary biology and chemistry. This study focuses on addressing these limitations by developing a flexible IbM that can robustly combine the biological, chemical and physical processes that dictate the emergent properties of a wide range of bacterial communities. This IbM is developed by creating a microbiological adaptation of the open source Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS). This innovation should provide the basis for “bottom up” prediction of the emergent behaviour of entire microbial systems. In the model presented here, bacterial growth, division, decay, mechanical contact among bacterial cells, and adhesion between the bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances are incorporated. In addition, fluid-bacteria interaction is implemented to simulate biofilm deformation and erosion. The model predicts that the surface morphology of biofilms becomes smoother with increased nutrient concentration, which agrees well with previous literature. In addition, the results show that increased shear rate results in smoother and more compact biofilms. The model can also predict shear rate dependent biofilm deformation, erosion, streamer formation and breakup.},

  abstract = {The nature of the siloxane surface in smectites was investigated by measuring the adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons from water by organo-clays. The organo-clays were prepared by replacing the hydrophilic, inorganic exchange cations of a series of smectites with the small, hydrophobic organic cation, trimethylphenylammonium (TMPA). Smectites with a range in charge densities were used that resulted in different TMPA contents in the organo-clays. Adsorption isotherms of benzene, alkylbenzenes, and naphthalene from water by the TMPA-smectites indicated that sorption was inversely related to TMPA content. The Langmuir form of the isotherms suggests that the aromatic compounds adsorb to the clay surface. Possible adsorptive sites in TMPA-smectites are limited to the TMPA cations and the siloxane oxygen surfaces. Because sorption increased as layer charge and TMPA content decreased, the organic compounds must adsorb to the siloxane surfaces. Calculations based on an adsorbed compound monolayer, which was estimated by fitting adsorption data to the Langmuir equation, and the N2 specific surface area of each TMPA-clay, indicate that the surface area occupied by each adsorbed molecule increases as the planar area of the molecule increases. This strongly indicates that the planar surfaces of the compounds adsorb directly to the clay surface. Apparently, the TMPA cations function to keep the smectite interlayers open. Interactions between the phenyl groups of TMPA cations on opposing interlayer clay surfaces may act to increase the size of the adsorptive regions. These results show that the siloxane surfaces of smectites can effectively adsorb aromatic hydrocarbons from water if the hydrophilic, inorganic exchange cations are replaced with small, hydrophobic organic cations. The strong adsorption of hydrophobic organic molecules from water dem- onstrates the hydrophobicity of the siloxane surfaces in smectites.},

To elucidate detailed antimicrobial modes of action against bacteria, cell integrity, outer membrane (OM), and inner membrane (IM) permeabilization assays were investigated. When treated with DMAEC, the release of 260 nm absorbing materials quickly increased for both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but the absorbance value was different due to the difference in cell structures. In OM and IM permeabilization assays, DMAEC rapidly increased 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine uptake and the release of cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase via an increase in the permeability of OM and IM. Moreover, DMAEC90 prepared from 90\% deacetylated chitosan had more activity than DMAEC50 prepared from 50\% deacetylated chitosan, and these results revealed that the antimicrobial action of water-soluble chitosans was dependent on the degree of deacetylation and the substituted group.},

  abstract = {A strain of Pseudomonas putida that can utilize naphthalene as its sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from soil. A mutant strain of this organism, P. putida 119, when grown on glucose in the presence of naphthalene, accumulates optically pure (+)-cis-1(R),2(S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene in the culture medium. The cis relative stereochemistry in this molecule was established by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Radiochemical trapping experiments established that this cis dihydrodiol is an intermediate in the metabolism of naphthalene by P. Fluorescens (formerly ATCC, 17483), P. putida (ATCC, 17484), and a Pseudomonas species (NCIB 9816), as well as the parent strain of P. putida described in this report. Formation of the cis dihydrodiol is catalyzed by a dioxygenase which requires either NADH or NADPH as an electron donor. A double label procedure is described for determining the origin of oxygen in the cis dihydrodiol under conditions where this metabolite would not normally accumulate. Several aromatic hydrocarbons are oxidized by cell extracts prepared from naphthalene-grown cells of P. putida. The cis dihydrodiol is converted to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene by an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase. This enzyme is specific for the (+) isomer of the dihydrodiol and shows a primary isotope effect when the dihydrodiol is substituted at C-2 with deuterium.},

Photocrosslinkable alginate macromers were prepared by reacting sodium alginate and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide. Methacrylated alginates were photocrosslinked using ultraviolet light with 0.05\% photoinitiator. The swelling behavior, elastic moduli, and degradation rates of photocrosslinked alginate hydrogels were quantified and could be controlled by varying the degree of alginate methacrylation. The methacrylated alginate macromer and photocrosslinked alginate hydrogels exhibited low cytotoxicity when cultured with primary bovine chondrocytes. In addition, chondrocytes encapsulated in these hydrogels remained viable and metabolically active as demonstrated by Live/Dead cell staining and MTS assay. These photocrosslinked alginate hydrogels, with tailorable mechanical properties and degradation rates, may find great utility as therapeutic materials in regenerative medicine and bioactive factor delivery. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We report x-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction measurements of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) monolayers at the water-air interface. Our investigations reveal that the structure and lateral ordering of the LPS molecules is very different from phospholipid systems and can be modulated by the ionic strength of the aqueous subphase in an ion-dependent manner. Our findings also indicate differential effects of monovalent and divalent ions on the two-dimensional ordering of lipid domains. Na+ ions interact unspecifically with LPS molecules based on their ability to efficiently screen the negative charges of the LPS molecules, whereas Ca2+ ions interact specifically by cross-linking adjacent molecules in the monolayer. At low lateral pressures, Na+ ions present in the subphase lead to a LPS monolayer structure ordered over large areas with high compressibility, nearly hexagonal packing of the hydrocarbon chains, and high density in the LPS headgroup region. At higher film pressures, the LPS monolayer becomes more rigid and results in a less perfect, oblique packing of the LPS hydrocarbon chains as well as a smaller lateral size of highly ordered domains on the monolayer. Furthermore, associated with the increased surface pressure, a conformational change of the sugar headgroups occurs, leading to a thickening of the entire LPS monolayer structure. The effect of Ca2+ ions in the subphase is to increase the rigidity of the LPS monolayer, leading to an oblique packing of the hydrocarbon chains already at low film pressures, an upright orientation of the sugar moieties, and much smaller sizes of ordered domains in the plane of the monolayer. In the presence of both Na+-and Ca2+ ions in the subphase, the screening effect of Na+ is predominant at low film pressures, whereas, at higher film pressures, the structure and lateral organization of LPS molecules is governed by the influence of Ca2+ ions. The unspecific charge-screening effect of the Na+ ions on the conformation of the sugar moiety becomes less dominant at biologically relevant lateral pressures. © 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

Nevertheless, research is still going on in the field of inoculant production to find methods to improve advanced formulation and application in fields. Conventionally used solid and liquid formulations encompass several problems with respect to the low viability of microorganisms during storage and field application. There is also lack of knowledge regarding the best carrier in conventional formulations. Immobilization of microorganisms however improves their shelf-life and field efficacy. In this context, microencapsulation is an advanced technology which has the possibility to overcome the drawbacks of other formulations, results in extended shelf-life, and controlled microbial release from formulations enhancing their application efficacy. This review discusses different microencapsulation technologies including the production strategies and application thereof in agricultural practices.},

Conclusions are presented, which identify the areas of potential commercial development as contaminated soil vitrification, volatile organic compounds (VOC) treatment and recovery, waste sludge processing, mineral ore grinding and carbon in pulp gold recovery. Reasons are detailed why other areas have not seen investment into and implementation of microwave heating technology. These include difficulties associated with the scaling up of laboratory units to industrial capacities and a lack of fundamental data on material dielectric properties. This has meant that commercialisation of microwave heating processes for environmental engineering applications has so far been slow. In fact, commercialisation is only deemed viable when microwave heating offers additional process-specific advantages over conventional methods of heating.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are emerging as alternative crop species for the production of fuels, chemicals, and biomass. Yet, the success of these microbes depends on the development of cost-effective technologies that permit scaled cultivation and cell harvesting. Here, we investigate the feasibility of engineering cell morphology to improve biomass recovery and decrease energetic costs associated with lysing cyanobacterial cells. Specifically, we modify the levels of Min system proteins in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The Min system has established functions in controlling cell division by regulating the assembly of FtsZ, a tubulin-like protein required for defining the bacterial division plane. We show that altering the expression of two FtsZ-regulatory proteins, MinC and Cdv3, enables control over cell morphology by disrupting FtsZ localization and cell division without preventing continued cell growth. By varying the expression of these proteins, we can tune the lengths of cyanobacterial cells across a broad dynamic range, anywhere from an ∼20\% increased length (relative to the wild type) to near-millimeter lengths. Highly elongated cells exhibit increased rates of sedimentation under low centrifugal forces or by gravity-assisted settling. Furthermore, hyperelongated cells are also more susceptible to lysis through the application of mild physical stress. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel approach toward decreasing harvesting and processing costs associated with mass cyanobacterial cultivation by altering morphology at the cellular level. IMPORTANCE We show that the cell length of a model cyanobacterial species can be programmed by rationally manipulating the expression of protein factors that suppress cell division. In some instances, we can increase the size of these cells to near-millimeter lengths with this approach. The resulting elongated cells have favorable properties with regard to cell harvesting and lysis. Furthermore, cells treated in this manner continue to grow rapidly at time scales similar to those of uninduced controls. To our knowledge, this is the first reported example of engineering the cell morphology of cyanobacteria or algae to make them more compatible with downstream processing steps that present economic barriers to their use as alternative crop species. Therefore, our results are a promising proof-of-principle for the use of morphology engineering to increase the cost-effectiveness of the mass cultivation of cyanobacteria for various sustainability initiatives.},

Microcoleus chthonoplastes mats were collected from hypersaline, coastal ponds at Guerrero Negro, Baja California. Gradients of spectral radiance, L, were measured at different angles through the mats and the spherically integrated scalar irradiance, Eo, was calculated. Maximal spectral light attenuation was found at the absorption peaks for the dominant photosynthetic pigments: chlorophyll a at 430 and 670 nm, carotenoids at 450–500 nm, phycocyanin at 620 nm, and bacteriochlorophyll a at 800–900 nm. Scattered light had a marked spectral effect on the scalar irradiance which near the mat surface reached up to 190\% of the incident irradiance. The spherically integrated irradiance thus differed strongly from the incident irradiance both in total intensity and in spectral composition. These basic optical properties are important for the understanding of photosynthesis and light harvesting in benthic and epiphytic communities.},

This is related to their diphasic structures, leading to multifunctional materials. The low-temperature processes which are used to synthesize such structures provide a wide versatility in the design of the compounds. The potentiality of the chemistry is to play on the structure of these mixtures and dissociate the various contributions in tailoring both phases and controlling the interfaces. In this paper, a review of some chemistry pathways to hybrid materials is presented. The nature of the bonds between organic and inorganic phases is used to divide them in two major families: class I corresponds to materials with weak interphase bonding, while class II corresponds to materials where both phases are chemically grafted. Applications of these materials in the fields of optics, iono-electronics, mechanics, biology and others are expected. Some applications are reviewed, with respect to the versatility of the synthetic procedure. Most of the properties of these new high-technology materials are dependent on their structural and chemical composition as well as on the dynamical properties inside the blends.},

  abstract = {Fatty aldehydes are an important group of fragrance and flavor compounds that are found in different fruits and flowers. A biotechnological synthesis of fatty aldehydes based on Escherichia coli cells expressing an α-dioxygenase (αDOX) from Oryza sativa (rice) is presented. α-Dioxygenases are the initial enzymes of α-oxidation in plants and oxidize long and medium-chain C(n) fatty acids to 2-hydroperoxy fatty acids. The latter are converted to C(n-1) fatty aldehydes by spontaneous decarboxylation. Successful expression of αDOX in E. coli was proven by an in vitro luciferase assay. Using resting cells of this recombinant E. coli strain, conversion of different fatty acids to the respective fatty aldehydes shortened by one carbon atom was demonstrated. The usage of Triton X 100 improves the conversion rate up to 1 g aldehyde per liter per hour. Easy reuse of the cells was demonstrated by performing a second biotransformation without any loss of biocatalytic activity.},

The latter allows for disentanglement of the particle orientation from other degrees of freedom and compensates for lateral shifts. The disentangled representations in the latent space encode the rich spectrum of local transitions that can now be visualized and explored via continuous variables. The time dependence of ensemble averages allows insight into the time dynamics of the system and, in particular, illustrates the presence of the potential ordering transition. Finally, analysis of the latent variables along the single-particle trajectory allows tracing these parameters on a single-particle level. The proposed approach is expected to be universally applicable for the description of the imaging data in optical, scanning probe, and electron microscopy seeking to understand the dynamics of complex systems where rotations are a significant part of the process.},

Aerobic methane-consuming bacteria (methanotrophs) represent a potential biological platform for methane-based biocatalysis. Here we use a multi-pronged systems-level approach to reassess the metabolic functions for methane utilization in a promising bacterial biocatalyst. We demonstrate that methane assimilation is coupled with a highly efficient pyrophosphate-mediated glycolytic pathway, which under oxygen limitation participates in a novel form of fermentation-based methanotrophy. This surprising discovery suggests a novel mode of methane utilization in oxygen-limited environments, and opens new opportunities for a modular approach towards producing a variety of excreted chemical products using methane as a feedstock.},

However, despite much progress, cell immobilization and maintenance within patterned microscale droplets remains a challenge. In particular, no method currently exists to rapidly seed cells into microwell arrays in a controllable and reliable manner. In this study, we present a simple wiping technique to localize cells within arrays of polymeric microwells. This robust method produces cell seeding densities that vary consistently with microwell geometry and cell concentration. Moreover, we develop a simple theoretical model to accurately predict cell seeding density and seeding efficiency in terms of the design parameters of the microwell array and the cell density. This short-term cell patterning approach is an enabling tool to develop new high-throughput screening technologies that utilize microwell arrays containing cells for screening applications.},

Confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is one of the most widely accessible approaches to measure protein and lipid diffusion in living cells. However, straightforward approaches to quantify confocal FRAP measurements in terms of absolute diffusion coefficients are currently lacking. Here, we report a simplified equation that can be used to extract diffusion coefficients from confocal FRAP data using the half time of recovery and effective bleach radius for a circular bleach region, and validate this equation for a series of fluorescently labeled soluble and membrane-bound proteins and lipids. We show that using this approach, diffusion coefficients ranging over three orders of magnitude can be obtained from confocal FRAP measurements performed under standard imaging conditions, highlighting its broad applicability.},

Techniques which have been used to immobilize whole cells include adsorption, aggregation, confinement and entrapment. These techniques can be applied to essentially all of the viable or non-viable whole cell systems of potential interest: microorganisms, animal and plant cells. The fact that immobilized cells may be living leads to unique effects in this form of heterogeneous catalysis. These include the impact of immobilization on cell physiology and cell mobility, physical interactions of immobilized cells with the support, and the creation of a microenvironment. The theory of mass-transfer and reaction in these types of systems is well understood, but schemes capable of predicting substrate and product diffusivities and the intrinsic kinetics in the aggregate must still be developed. New experimental approaches are being used to elucidate the basic mechanisms that determine these physical and metabolic properties of immobilized cells. Several reactor configurations have been successfully used with immobilized cells, and many more have been proposed. The choice of a particular design for a given process depends on the requirements for mass-transfer, the growth behaviour of the cells, and the structural properties of the aggregate. © 1985.},

  abstract = {When cyanobacteria are starved for nitrogen, expression of the NblA protein increases and thereby induces proteolytic degradation of phycobilisomes, light-harvesting complexes of pigmented proteins. Phycobilisome degradation leads to a color change of the cells from blue-green to yellow-green, referred to as bleaching or chlorosis. As reported previously, NblA binds via a conserved region at its C terminus to the α-subunits of phycobiliproteins, the main components of phycobilisomes. We demonstrate here that a highly conserved stretch of amino acids in the N-terminal helix of NblA is essential for protein function in vivo. Affinity purification of glutathione S-transferase-tagged NblA, expressed in a Nostoc sp. PCC7120 mutant lacking wildtype NblA, resulted in co-precipitation of ClpC, encoded by open reading frame alr2999 of the Nostoc chromosome. ClpC is a HSP100 chaperone partner of the Clp protease. ATP-dependent binding of NblA to ClpC was corroborated by in vitro pull-down assays. Introducing amino acid exchanges, we verified that the conserved N-terminal motif of NblA mediates the interaction with ClpC. Further results indicate that NblA binds phycobiliprotein subunits and ClpC simultaneously, thus bringing the proteins into close proximity. Altogether these results suggest that NblA may act as an adaptor protein that guides a ClpC·ClpP complex to the phycobiliprotein disks in the rods of phycobilisomes, thereby initiating the degradation process. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

However, the AFM tip interacts strongly with the sample, and its z range freedom is limited to a few micrometers. This means that the cells to be imaged have to be strongly attached to the substrate, and imaging is restricted to cells having a flattened shape. Here we propose a simple and inexpensive solution to overcome these limitations. The method we propose is trapping living round shaped cells in a Millipore filter with a pore size comparable to the dimensions of the cell. The highest part of some of the blocked cells protrude through the holes of the filter and can this way be easily observed using the AFM without detachment. © 1995, The Biophysical Society.

Such a fluid state allows free motion of constituents within the membrane bilayer and is extremely important for membrane function. The term "membrane fluidity" is a general concept, which refers to the ease of motion for mols. in the highly anisotropic membrane environment. We give a brief description of phys. parameters assocd. with membrane fluidity, such as rotational and translational diffusion rates, order parameters etc., and review phys. methods used for their detn.

Therefore, the hydrogel was suitable for encapsulation of biomolecules for preparation of biodevices, such as bioreactors and biosensors.},

Ideally, the ink is transferred from stamp to substrate only in the area of contact. This review focuses on the important role of polymers in small muCP. First of all, polymers are the material of choice to make small muCP stamps. Furthermore, small muCP is a useful method for preparing microstructured polymer surfaces. Polymers can be applied as inks in small muCP so that microstructured polymer surfaces are obtained in a single printing step. Microstructured polymer surfaces can also be obtained by small muCP on polymer substrates. A wide range of inks - including polymer inks - can be patterned on polymer substrates by small muCP. In short, polymers are widely used as stamps, inks and substrates in small muCP and we have organized this review accordingly.},

However, the Nostoc CcmL structure shows an interesting pattern of behavior where two loops that map to the base of the pentamer adopt either an out or in conformation, with a consistent (over six pentamers) out-in-out-in-in pattern of protomers. The pentamers in this structure are also consistently organized into a back-to-back decamer, though evidence suggests that this is likely not present in solution. Förster resonance energy transfer experiments were able to show a weak interaction between CcmL and CcmK2 when CcmK2 was present at {$>$}100 μM. Since CcmK2 forms defined bodies with approximately 200 nm diameter at this concentration, this would support the idea that CcmL can only interact with CcmK2 at rare defect points in the growing shell. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Nevertheless, the limited accuracy with which we can predict interspecies interactions and environmental dependencies hinders efforts to rationally engineer beneficial consortia. Empirical screening is a complementary approach wherein synthetic communities are combinatorially constructed and assayed in high throughput. However, assembling many combinations of microbes is logistically complex and difficult to achieve on a timescale commensurate with microbial growth. Here, we introduce the kChip, a droplets-based platform that performs rapid, massively parallel, bottom-up construction and screening of synthetic microbial communities. We first show that the kChip enables phenotypic characterization of microbes across environmental conditions. Next, in a screen of ∼100,000 multispecies communities comprising up to 19 soil isolates, we identified sets that promote the growth of the model plant symbiont Herbaspirillum frisingense in a manner robust to carbon source variation and the presence of additional species. Broadly, kChip screening can identify multispecies consortia possessing any optically assayable function, including facilitation of biocontrol agents, suppression of pathogens, degradation of recalcitrant substrates, and robustness of these functions to perturbation, with many applications across basic and applied microbial ecology.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in theoretical ecology is understanding how natural microbial communities support species diversity, and in particular how antibiotic-producing, -sensitive and -resistant species coexist. While cyclic ‘rock–paper–scissors’ interactions can stabilize communities in spatial environments, coexistence in unstructured environments remains unexplained. Here, using simulations and analytical models, we show that the opposing actions of antibiotic production and degradation enable coexistence even in well-mixed environments. Coexistence depends on three-way interactions in which an antibiotic-degrading species attenuates the inhibitory interactions between two other species. These interactions enable coexistence that is robust to substantial differences in inherent species growth rates and to invasion by ‘cheating’ species that cease to produce or degrade antibiotics. At least two antibiotics are required for stability, with greater numbers of antibiotics enabling more complex communities and diverse dynamic behaviours ranging from stable fixed points to limit cycles and chaos. Together, these results show how multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability in both spatially structured and mixed microbial communities, suggesting strategies for engineering synthetic ecosystems and highlighting the importance of toxin production and degradation for microbial biodiversity.},

  abstract = {All cyanobacteria contain carboxysomes, RuBisCO-encapsulating bacterial microcompartments that function as prokaryotic organelles. The two carboxysome types, alpha and beta, differ fundamentally in components, assembly, and species distribution. Alpha carboxysomes share a highly-conserved gene organization, with evidence of horizontal gene transfer from chemoautotrophic proteobacteria to the picocyanobacteria, and seem to co-assemble shells concomitantly with aggregation of cargo enzymes. In contrast, beta carboxysomes assemble an enzymatic core first, with an encapsulation peptide playing a critical role in formation of the surrounding shell. Based on similarities in assembly, and phylogenetic analysis of the pentameric shell protein conserved across all bacterial microcompartments, beta carboxysomes appear to be more closely related to the microcompartments of heterotrophic bacteria (metabolosomes) than to alpha carboxysomes, which appear deeply divergent. Beta carboxysomes can be found in the basal cyanobacterial clades that diverged before the ancestor of the chloroplast and have recently been shown to be able to encapsulate functional RuBisCO enzymes resurrected from ancestrally-reconstructed sequences, consistent with an ancient origin. Alpha and beta carboxysomes are not only distinct units of evolution, but are now emerging as genetic/metabolic modules for synthetic biology; heterologous expression and redesign of both the shell and the enzymatic core have recently been achieved.},

Biocatalysis shows a distinct advantage over the chemical route in terms of process simplification, quality of product, and reduction in waste formation. Lipases are the most commonly used enzymes for enzyme-catalyzed synthesis in the cosmetic industry because they have the ability to recognize a wide variety of substrates and catalyze a large number of reactions. The first half of the present article gives a brief overview of the role of biocatalysts in the synthesis of various cosmetic esters. The second half of the review points out the limitations of conventional biocatalytic synthesis of cosmetic esters and discusses the application of novel green techniques such as ultrasonication and microwave irradiation to address the drawbacks of the conventional enzymatic technique.},

  abstract = {Two new mutations in the cell division gene ftsW have been isolated and characterized. The ftsW263(Ts) mutation results in a block to division at the initiation stage, similar to that previously observed with the ftsW201(Ts) mutation. The ftsW1640(Ts) mutation, however, causes a block to division at a later stage. The ftsW201 and ftsW263 mutants were shown to be phenotypically sensitive to the genetic background and growth conditions and are possibly relA dependent. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the FtsZ protein can localize to presumptive division sites in strains carrying ftsW(Ts) mutations at the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that FtsW is unlikely to be specifically required for the localization of FtsZ to the division site. Examination of the localization of FtsZ in an ftsW rodA double mutant (lemon-shaped cells) revealed several classes of cells ranging from a common class where an FtsZ ring structure is absent to a class where FtsZ forms a complete ring at the midpoint of a lemon-shaped cell, suggesting a role for FtsW in the establishment of a stable FtsZ-based septal structure. We further demonstrate that two FtsW peptides, FtsWL (large) and FtsWS (small), can be identified and that the expression of ftsWS is sufficient for complementation of ftsW(Ts) mutations. The initiation of cell division in Escherichia coli involves the formation of a ring of the GTP-binding (9, 27, 29), tubulin-like (10, 27a) FtsZ protein around the inner membrane of the cell at the mid-cell division site (5, 24, 36). Other division proteins such as FtsA, FtsQ, and FtsI are believed to act after the formation of the FtsZ ring (1, 3). The product of the recently identified ftsK gene is believed to be required at a very late stage in division (4). ftsW was originally identified and sequenced by Ikeda et al. (15, 16). The peptide sequence as deduced from the DNA sequence showed (i) homology to the Bacillus subtilis SpoVE protein, which is required for asymmetric division during sporulation, and (ii) similarity to the RodA protein, which is required for elongation and maintenance of the rod shape in E. coli (15, 25). Genetic analysis of the ftsW201(Ts) allele revealed that this mutation caused a block to division at an early stage (20), comparable to that caused in strains carrying the ftsZ84(Ts) allele, using the same genetic analysis (3). We therefore suggested a role for FtsW at the initiation stage of cell division which could involve an interaction with FtsZ (20). We also identified the FtsW peptide as the product of trans-lation of ftsW from the first of two possible, and in-frame, start codons (15, 20). In this paper, we report on the isolation and characterization of two new ftsW(Ts) alleles, the identification of a smaller FtsW peptide, and the detection of FtsZ localiza-tion in ftsW mutants.},

A forty kilobase region of DNA containing most of the genes for the degradation of these aromatic compounds was previously cloned and sequenced. Insertional inactivation of bphC results in the inability of B1 to grow on both polycyclic and monocyclic compounds. Complementation experiments indicate that the metabolic block is actually due to a polar effect on the expression of bphA3, coding for a ferredoxin component of a dioxygenase. Lack of the ferredoxin results in a nonfunctional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dioxygenase and a nonfunctional toluate dioxygenase indicating that the electron transfer components are capable of interacting with multiple oxygenase components. Insertional inactivation of a gene for a dioxygenase oxygenase component downstream of bphA3 had no apparent effect on growth besides a polar effect on nahD which is only needed for growth of B1 on naphthalene. Insertional inactivation of either xylE or xylG in the meta-cleavage operon results in a polar effect on bphB, the last gene in the operon. However, insertional inactivation of xylX at the beginning of this cluster of genes does not result in a polar effect suggesting that the genes for the meta-cleavage pathway, although colinear, are organized in at least two operons. These experiments confirm the biological role of several genes involved in metabolism of aromatic compounds by S. yanoikuyae B1 and demonstrate the interdependency of the metabolic pathways for polycyclic and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation.},

This creates double-emulsion drops, using a single-step emulsification, having a very thin fluid shell. If the shell is solidified, its thickness can be small as a hundred nanometres or even less. Despite the small thickness of this shell, these structures are nevertheless very stable, giving them great potential for encapsulation. We demonstrate this by creating biodegradable microcapsules of poly(lactic acid) with a shell thickness of a few tens of nanometres, which are potentially useful for encapsulation and delivery of drugs, cosmetics, and nutrients.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that for microbial communities, "fences make good neighbors." Communities of soil microorganisms perform critical functions: controlling climate, enhancing crop production, and remediation of environmental contamination. Microbial communities in the oral cavity and the gut are of high biomedical interest. Understanding and harnessing the function of these communities is difficult: artificial microbial communities in the laboratory become unstable because of "winner-takes-all" competition among species. We constructed a community of three different species of wild-type soil bacteria with syntrophic interactions using a microfluidic device to control spatial structure and chemical communication. We found that defined microscale spatial structure is both necessary and sufficient for the stable coexistence of interacting bacterial species in the synthetic community. A mathematical model describes how spatial structure can balance the competition and positive interactions within the community, even when the rates of production and consumption of nutrients by species are mismatched, by exploiting nonlinearities of these processes. These findings provide experimental and modeling evidence for a class of communities that require microscale spatial structure for stability, and these results predict that controlling spatial structure may enable harnessing the function of natural and synthetic multispecies communities in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes that are able to assimilate CO2 using solar energy and water. Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria has suggested the possibility of direct CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals. However, engineering of cyanobacteria has been limited due to the lack of various genetic tools for expression and control of multiple genes to reconstruct metabolic pathways for biochemicals from CO2. Thus, we developed SyneBrick vectors as a synthetic biology platform for gene expression in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 as a model cyanobacterium. The SyneBrick chromosomal integration vectors provide three inducible expression systems to control gene expression and three neutral sites for chromosomal integrations. Using a SyneBrick vector, LacI-regulated gene expression led to 24-fold induction of the eYFP reporter gene with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducer in S. elongatus PCC 7942 under 5\% (v/v) CO2. TetR-regulated gene expression led to 19-fold induction of the GFP gene when 100 nM anhydrotetracycline (aTc) inducer was used. Gene expression decreased after 48 h due to degradation of aTc under light. T7 RNA polymerase-based gene expression resulted in efficient expression with a lower IPTGconcentration than a previously developed pTrc promoter. A library of T7 promoters can be used for tunable gene expression. In summary, SyneBrick vectors were developed as a synthetic biology platform for gene expression in S. elongatus PCC 7942. These results will accelerate metabolic engineering of biosolar cell factories through expressing and controlling multiple genes of interest.},

  abstract = {An evolutionary game emerges when a subset of individuals incur costs to provide benefits to all individuals. Public goods games (PGG) cover the essence of such dilemmas in which cooperators are prone to exploitation by defectors. We model the population dynamics of a non-linear PGG and consider density-dependence on the global level, while the game occurs within local neighborhoods. At low cooperation, increases in the public good provide increasing returns. At high cooperation, increases provide diminishing returns. This mechanism leads to diverse evolutionarily stable strategies, including monomorphic and polymorphic populations, and neighborhood-size-driven state changes, resulting in hysteresis between equilibria. Stochastic or strategy-dependent variations in neighborhood sizes favor coexistence by destabilizing monomorphic states. We integrate our model with experiments of cancer cell growth and confirm that our framework describes PGG dynamics observed in cellular populations. Our findings advance the understanding of how neighborhood-size effects in PGG shape the dynamics of growing populations.},

The accumulation of compatible solutes is often observed during the acclimation of organisms to adverse environmental conditions, particularly to salt and drought stress. Among cyanobacteria, sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol and glycine betaine are used as major compatible solutes. Interestingly, a close correlation has been discovered between the final salt tolerance limit and the primary compatible solute in these organisms. In addition to the dominant compatible solutes, many strains accumulate mixtures of these compounds, including minor compounds such as glucosylglycerate or proline as secondary or tertiary solutes. In particular, the accumulation of sucrose and trehalose results in an increase in tolerance to general stresses such as desiccation and high temperatures. During recent years, the biochemical and molecular basis of compatible solute accumulation has been characterized using cyanobacterial model strains that comprise different salt tolerance groups. Based on these data, the distribution of genes involved in compatible solute synthesis among sequenced cyanobacterial genomes is reviewed, and thereby, the major compatible solutes and potential salt tolerance of these strains can be predicted. Knowledge regarding cyanobacterial salt tolerance is not only useful to characterize strain-specific adaptations to ecological niches, but it can also be used to generate cells with increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions for biotechnological purposes.},

  abstract = {Straight-through microchannel (MC) emulsification is a novel technique for formulating monodisperse emulsions using an array of micrometer-sized channels vertical to the surface of a silicon plate (a straight-through MC). We studied the effects of the type and physical properties of the dispersed oil phase and of the surfactant concentration on droplet formation from a straight-through MC by experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Monodisperse oil-in-water emulsions with coefficients of variation below 4\% were formulated from an oblong straight-through MC using silicone oils, tetradecane, medium-chain triglyceride, soybean oil, and liquid paraffin as the oil phase. At oil viscosities (eta(d)) lower than a threshold value of 100 mPa s, the values of the resultant droplet diameter (d(ex)) gradually decreased with increasing eta(d), whereas they were not affected by the surfactant concentration. Conversely, at eta(d) higher than the threshold value, the d(ex) values significantly increased with increasing eta(d), and they were affected by the surfactant concentration. An analysis on the basis of droplet formation time and interfacial tension clarified that the trends in d(ex) at eta(d) above the threshold value would be caused by the significant decrease in the dynamic interfacial tension during droplet formation. We thus discovered that the dynamic interfacial tension is also a parameter affecting the d(ex) along with eta(d) in straight-through MC emulsification. CFD simulations using a three-dimensional (3D) model including a straight-through MC confirmed successful formation of micrometer-sized droplets for the above-mentioned oils. The experimental and CFD results for the resultant droplet size were compared using the dimensionless droplet diameter (d, droplet diameter/channel equivalent diameter). The d(CFD) values agreed well with the d(ex) values at eta(d) below the threshold value of 100 mPa s for all the experiment systems and at eta(d) above the threshold value for the experiment systems that did not contain a surfactant.},

These microstructures were fabricated using photolithography on silicon, glass or poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces modified with a 3-(trichlorosilyl) propyl methacrylate (TPM) monolayer. During the photogelation reaction, the resulting hydrogel microstructures were covalently bound to the substrate via the TPM monolayer and did not detached from the substrate upon hydration. For mammalian cell patterning, microwell arrays of different dimensions were fabricated. These microwells were composed of hydrophilic PEG hydrogel walls surrounding hydrophobic TPM floors inside the microwells. Murine 3T3 fibroblasts and transformed hepatocytes were shown to selectively adhere to the TPM monolayer inside the microwells, maintaining their viability, while adherent cells were not present on the hydrogel walls. The number of cells inside one microwell could be controled by changing the lateral dimension of the microwells, thus allowing only a single cell per microwell if desired. In the case of 30 x 30 pm microwells, as many as 400 microwells were fabricated in 1 mm(2). In addition, PEG hydrogel microstructures were also shown to effectively resist the adhesion of bacteria such as Escherichia coli.},

  abstract = {Bacteria are social organisms that possess multiple pathways for sensing and responding to small molecules produced by other microbes. Most bacteria in nature exist in sessile communities called biofilms, and the ability of biofilm bacteria to sense and respond to small molecule signals and cues produced by neighboring biofilm bacteria is particularly important. To understand microbial interactions between biofilms, it is necessary to perform rapid, real-time spatial quantification of small molecules in microenvironments immediately surrounding biofilms; however, such measurements have been elusive. In this study, scanning electrochemical microscopy was used to quantify small molecules surrounding a biofilm in 3D space. Measuring concentrations of the redox-active signaling molecule pyocyanin (PYO) produced by biofilms of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed a high concentration of PYO that is actively maintained in the reduced state proximal to the biofilm. This gradient results in a reduced layer of PYO that we have termed the PYO “electrocline,” a gradient of redox potential, which extends several hundred microns from the biofilm surface. We also demonstrate that the PYO electrocline is formed under electron acceptor-limiting conditions, and that growth conditions favoring formation of the PYO electrocline correlate to an increase in soluble iron. Additionally, we have taken a “reactive image” of a biofilm surface, demonstrating the rate of bacterial redox activity across a 2D surface. These studies establish methodology for spatially coordinated concentration and redox status measurements of microbe-produced small molecules and provide exciting insights into the roles these molecules play in microbial competition and nutrient acquisition.},

Here, we present a novel trapping design to easily and reliably load a high density of cells into culture chambers that are extremely isolated from potentially damaging flow effects. We utilize a transient on-chip vacuum to remove air from the culture chambers and rapidly replace the volume with a liquid cell suspension. We demonstrate the ability of this simple and robust method to load and culture three commonly used cell lines. We show how the incorporation of an on-chip function generator can be used for dynamic stimulation of cells during long-term continuous perfusion culture. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Specifically, we created six two-strain consortia, each possessing a unique mode of interaction, including commensalism, amensalism, neutralism, cooperation, competition and predation. These consortia follow distinct population dynamics with characteristics determined by the underlying interaction modes. We showed that models derived from two-strain consortia can be used to design three- and four-strain ecosystems with predictable behaviors and further extended to provide insights into community dynamics in space. This work sheds light on the organization of interacting microbial species and provides a systematic framework—social interaction programming—to guide the development of synthetic ecosystems for diverse purposes.},

Microbiological conversion of lignin is almost exclusive to fungi, usually resulting in increased cell mass and lignolytic enzymes. Some bacteria can also degrade lignin-related compounds using the β-ketoadipate pathway; for example, Rhodococcus opacus DSM 1069 can degrade coniferyl alcohol and grow on it as sole carbon source. Moreover, this strain belongs to the actinomycetes group that is also known for oleaginous species with lipid accumulation over 20\%. Present work shows that R. opacus DSM 1069 and PD630 strains under nitrogen limiting conditions can convert lignin model compounds into triacylglycerols, also known as neutral lipids. 4-Hydroxybenzoic and vanillic acid lignin model compounds were used as sole carbon sources, and after brief adaptation periods, the cells not only began growing but accumulated lipids to the level of oleaginicity. These lipids were extracted for transesterification and analysis of fatty acid methyl esters showed good composition for biodiesel applications with no aromatics. Furthermore, the two strains showed distinct substrate metabolism and product profiles.},

  abstract = {We do not know how or why multicellularity evolved. We used the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to ask whether nutrients that must be digested extracellularly select for the evolution of undifferentiated multicellularity. Because yeast use invertase to hydrolyze sucrose extracellularly and import the resulting monosaccharides, single cells cannot grow at low cell and sucrose concentrations. Three engineered strategies overcame this problem: forming multicellular clumps, importing sucrose before hydrolysis, and increasing invertase expression. We evolved populations in low sucrose to ask which strategy they would adopt. Of 12 successful clones, 11 formed multicellular clumps through incomplete cell separation, 10 increased invertase expression, none imported sucrose, and 11 increased hexose transporter expression, a strategy we had not engineered. Identifying causal mutations revealed genes and pathways, which frequently contributed to the evolved phenotype. Our study shows that combining rational design with experimental evolution can help evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary strategies.Life first appeared on Earth more than 3 billion years ago in the form of single-celled microorganisms. The diverse array of complex life forms that we see today evolved from these humble beginnings, but it is not clear what triggered the evolution of multicellular organisms from single cells.One of the simplest multicellular eukaryotes is the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae—a fungus that has been used for centuries in baking and brewing and, more recently, as a model organism in molecular biology. Yeast cells feed on sugar (sucrose), but are unable to absorb it directly from their surroundings. Instead they secrete an enzyme called invertase, which breaks down the sucrose into simpler components that cells can take up with the help of sugar transporters.However, single yeast cells living in a low-sucrose environment face a problem: most of the simple sugars that they produce diffuse out of reach. To overcome this difficulty, the cells could form multicellular clumps, which would enable each cell to consume the sugars that drift away from its neighbours. Alternatively, the cells could increase their production of invertase, or they could begin to take up sucrose directly.Using genetic engineering, Koschwanez et al. produced three strains of yeast, each with one of these traits, and confirmed that all three strategies do indeed help fungi to grow in low sucrose. But could any of these traits evolve spontaneously? To test this possibility, Koschwanez et al. introduced wild-type yeast cells into a low-sucrose environment and studied any populations of cells that managed to survive. Of 12 that did, 11 had acquired the ability to form multicellular clumps, while 10 had increased their expression of invertase. Surprisingly, none had evolved the ability to import sucrose. However, 11 of the populations that survived also displayed an adaptation that the researchers had not predicted beforehand: they all expressed higher levels of the sugar transporters that take up sucrose breakdown products.The work of Koschwanez et al. suggests that the benefits of being able to share invertase and, therefore, simple sugars, may have driven the evolution of multicellularity in ancient organisms. Moreover, their use of rational design (engineered mutations) combined with experimental evolution (allowing colonies to grow under selection pressure and studying the strategies that they adopt) offers a new approach to studying evolution in the lab.},

  abstract = {Access to chiral alcohols of high optical purity is today frequently provided by the enzymatic reduction of precursor ketones. However, bioreductions are complicated by the need for reducing equivalents in the form of NAD(P)H. The high price and molecular weight of NAD(P)H necessitate in situ recycling of catalytic quantities, which is mostly accomplished by enzymatic oxidation of a cheap co-substrate. The coupled oxidoreduction can be either performed by free enzymes in solution or by whole cells. Reductase selection, the decision between cell-free and whole cell reduction system, coenzyme recycling mode and reaction conditions represent design options that strongly affect bioreduction efficiency. In this paper, each option was critically scrutinized and decision rules formulated based on well-described literature examples. The development chain was visualized as a decision-tree that can be used to identify the most promising route towards the production of a specific chiral alcohol. General methods, applications and bottlenecks in the set-up are presented and key experiments required to "test" for decision-making attributes are defined. The reduction of o-chloroacetophenone to (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)ethanol was used as one example to demonstrate all the development steps. Detailed analysis of reported large scale bioreductions identified product isolation as a major bottleneck in process design.},

  abstract = {In this paper attention is focused on intraparticle diffusion of multicomponent gaseous mixtures in macroporous and microporous media. Bulk, Knudsen and surface diffusion will be handled using a unified, consistent, approach, borrowing ideas and concepts developed more than a century ago by James Clerk Maxwell and Josef Stefan. The diffusion equations for bulk and Knudsen equations coincide with the dusty gas model, rediscovered already about five times in history. The walls of the porous adsorbent are modelled as giant dust molecules and in this theory they are accorded the status of pseudo-species. One advantage of this procedure is that the kinetic gas theory may now be used to predict the Knudsen diffusion coefficients. For the description of surface diffusion of multicomponent mixtures a new approach is developed in which the vacant sites are modelled, additionally, as pseudo-speices (craters on the dust "molecules"). Then practical application of the crated dusty gas model is illustrated by considering a number of studies, including (1) single-component sorption; (2) uptake of binary mixtures by zeolites and activated carbon; (3) multicomponent diffusion and chemical reaction within catalyst pellets. The examples discussed in this paper support the contention that the Fick formulation is hopelessly inadequate because it will fail even at the qualitative level to describe the observed experimental phenomena. The Maxwell-Stefan formulation provides a useful tool for solving practical problems in intraparticle diffusion. ?? 1993.},

Non-ionic detergents stimulated the specific activity of the enzyme. Enantioselectivity of the enzyme was strongly affected by several detergents. Thesit and sucrosemonolaurate had the most pronounced effects and enantiomeric ratios were strongly enhanced. The effects are most likely due to the ability of detergents to stabilise membrane-proteins by forming micelles and thus mimicking the membrane structure. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

On evaluating the present state of the cyanobacterial systems, it can be said that for Anacystis nidulans R2 (unicellular, obligately photoautotrophic, nonnitrogen fixing), a complete system has been developed and the first results have been obtained. Two strategies have been employed for developing host–vector systems. One uses hybrid plasmids that contain both a cyanobacterial and an Escherichia coli origin of replication. The other makes use of the integrational vectors that employ the extremely efficient recombination documented for at least two species, A. nidulans R2 and Synechocystis PCC6803. Anacystis nidulans is an obligately photoautotrophic organism, implying that along with benefits from light, it is also continuously exposed to the hazardous effects of solar radiation. Thus, A. nidulans R2 has an extremely efficient system of recombination, because recombination is intimately involved in the repair of radiation damage. The main characteristics of a good vector, in addition to easy manipulation in E. coli, are high transformation efficiency and stable maintenance in the cyanobacterium. © 1987, Elsevier Inc.

The development of quorum sensing devices, the cornerstone technology for building microbial communities with coordinated system behaviour, has largely focused on reducing signal leakage between systems of cognate AHL/transcription factor pairs. However, the use of non-cognate signals as a design feature has received limited attention so far. Here, we demonstrate the largest library of AHL-receiver devices constructed to date with all cognate and non-cognate chemical signal interactions quantified and we develop a software tool that allows automated selection of orthogonal chemical channels. We use this approach to identify up to four orthogonal channels in silico and experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous use of three channels in co-culture. The development of multiple non-interfering cell-to-cell communication channels will facilitate the design of synthetic microbial consortia for novel applications including distributed bio-computation, increased bioprocess efficiency, cell specialisation, and spatial organisation.},

For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures. © 1982.},

Crystalline bacterial cell surface layer (S-layer) proteins are among the most abundant biopolymers on earth and form the outermost cell envelope component in a broad range of bacteria and archaea. The unique feature of S-layer based imprints is the crystalline character of the reassembled S-layer protein lattice leading to a precisely controllable periodicity of surface functional groups and topographical features. By determining the Young (elastic) modulus of the S-layer protein with respect to that of the polymer at its gel point, the feasibility of the S-layer based biomolecular imprinting was confirmed. After imprinting the polymer with an S-layer coated silicon stamp, the sensitivity of the imprints and their selectivity in relation to various other proteins were investigated by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies. Furtheron, polycationic ferritin (PCF) was bound in a dense packing on the S-layer and subsequently used for stamping. Successful rebinding of PCF proved that the S-layer lattice can be used as a template for making imprints of densely packed and, probably, perfectly oriented biologically functional molecules, a concept that can in principle be extended to a wide range of other biomolecules (e.g. antibodies).},

  abstract = {Once described as mere "bags of enzymes," bacterial cells are in fact highly organized, with many macromolecules exhibiting non-uniform localization patterns. Yet the physical and biochemical mechanisms that govern this spatial heterogeneity remain largely unknown. Here, we identify liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a mechanism for organizing clusters of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in Escherichia coli. Using fluorescence imaging, we show that RNAP quickly transitions from a dispersed to clustered localization pattern as cells enter log phase in nutrient-rich media. RNAP clusters are sensitive to hexanediol, a chemical that dissolves liquid-like compartments in eukaryotic cells. In addition, we find that the transcription antitermination factor NusA forms droplets in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it may nucleate RNAP clusters. Finally, we use single-molecule tracking to characterize the dynamics of cluster components. Our results indicate that RNAP and NusA molecules move inside clusters, with mobilities faster than a DNA locus but slower than bulk diffusion through the nucleoid. We conclude that RNAP clusters are biomolecular condensates that assemble through LLPS. This work provides direct evidence for LLPS in bacteria and demonstrates that this process can serve as a mechanism for intra-cellular organization in prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike.

  abstract = {Glucose is the main sugar transport form in animals, whereas plants use sucrose to supply non-photosynthetic organs with carbon skeletons and energy. Many aspects of sucrose transport, metabolism, and signaling are not well understood, including the route of sucrose efflux from leaf mesophyll cells and transport across vacuolar membranes. Tools that can detect sucrose with high spatial and temporal resolution in intact organs may help elucidate the players involved. Here, FRET sensors were generated by fusing putative sucrose-binding proteins to green fluorescent protein variants. Plant-associated bacteria such as Rhizobium and Agrobacterium can use sucrose as a nutrient source; sugar-binding proteins were, thus, used as scaffolds for developing sucrose nanosensors. Among a set of putative sucrose-binding protein genes cloned in between eCFP and eYFP and tested for sugar-dependent FRET changes, an Agrobacterium sugar-binding protein bound sucrose with 4 mum affinity. This FLIPsuc-4mu protein also recognized other sugars including maltose, trehalose, and turanose and, with lower efficiency, glucose and palatinose. Homology modeling enabled the prediction of binding pocket mutations to modulate the relative affinity of FLIPsuc-4mu for sucrose, maltose, and glucose. Mutant nanosensors showed up to 50- and 11-fold increases in specificity for sucrose over maltose and glucose, respectively, and the sucrose binding affinity was simultaneously decreased to allow detection in the physiological range. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of the sucrose nanosensor was improved by linker engineering. This novel reagent complements FLIPs for glucose, maltose, ribose, glutamate, and phosphate and will be used for analysis of sucrose-derived carbon flux in bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal cells.},

  abstract = {Photosensitized biological processes, as applied in photodynamic therapy, are based on light-triggered generation of molecular singlet oxygen by a membrane-residing sensitizer. Most of the sensitizers currently used are hydrophobic or amphiphilic porphyrins and their analogs. The possible activity of the short-lived singlet oxygen is limited to the time it is diffusing in the membrane, before it emerges into the aqueous environment. In this paper we demonstrate the enhancement of the photosensitization process that is obtained by newly synthesized protoporphyrin derivatives, which insert their tetrapyrrole chromophore deeper into the lipid bilayer of liposomes. The insertion was measured by fluorescence quenching by iodide and the photosensitization efficiency was measured with 9,10-dimethylanthracene, a fluorescent chemical target for singlet oxygen. We also show that when the bilayer undergoes a melting phase transition, or when it is fluidized by benzyl alcohol, the sensitization efficiency decreases because of the enhanced diffusion of singlet oxygen. The addition of cholesterol or of dimyristoyl phosphatydilcholine to the bilayer moves the porphyrin deeper into the bilayer; however, the ensuing effect on the sensitization efficiency is different in these two cases. These results could possibly define an additional criterion for the choice and design of hydrophobic, membrane-bound photosensitizers.},

  abstract = {The ecology of hydrocarbon degradation by microbial populations in the natural environment is reviewed, emphasizing the physical, chemical, and biological factors that contribute to the biodegradation of petroleum and individual hydrocarbons. Rates of biodegradation depend greatly on the composition, state, and concentration of the oil or hydrocarbons, with dispersion and emulsification enhancing rates in aquatic systems and absorption by soil particulates being the key feature of terrestrial ecosystems. Temperature and oxygen and nutrient concentrations are important variables in both types of environments. Salinity and pressure may also affect biodegradation rates in some aquatic environments, and moisture and pH may limit biodegradation in soils. Hydrocarbons are degraded primarily by bacteria and fungi. Adaptation by prior exposure of microbial communities to hydrocarbons increases hydrocarbon degradation rates. Adaptation is brought about by selective enrichment of hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms and amplification of the pool of hydrocarbon-catabolizing genes. The latter phenomenon can now be monitored through the use of DNA probes. Increases in plasmid frequency may also be associated with genetic adaptation. Seeding to accelerate rates of biodegradation has been shown to be effective in some cases, particularly when used under controlled conditions, such as in fermentors or chemostats.},

Using strains that possess portions of the NAH system, this preferential degradation was localized to the activity of naphthalene dioxygenase. Comparisons of the first-order rates of compound degradation with the structures of the mixture components indicated that increased deviation from the base structure of naphthalene led to slower disappearance. Structural features that were found to decrease the rate of compound degradation include an increase in the number of methyl substituents and an increase in the size of a substituent.

In cyanobacteria, a homologous protein (activase-like cyanobacterial protein, ALC), contains a distinctive C-terminal fusion resembling the small-subunit of rubisco. Although cyanobacterial rubisco is believed to be less sensitive to RuBP inhibition, the ALC is widely distributed among diverse cyanobacteria. Using microscopy, biochemistry and molecular biology, the cellular localization of the ALC, its effect on carboxysome/cell ultrastructure in Fremyella diplosiphon, and its function in vitro were studied. Bioinformatic analysis uncovered evolutionary relationships between the ALC and rubisco. ALC localizes to carboxysomes and exhibits ATPase activity. Furthermore, the ALC induces rubisco aggregation in a manner similar to that of another carboxysomal protein, M35, and this activity is affected by ATP. An alc deletion mutant showed modified cell morphology when grown under enriched CO2 and impaired regulation of carboxysome biogenesis, without affecting growth rate. Carbamylation of Fremyella recombinant rubisco was inhibited by RuBP, but this inhibition was not relieved by the ALC. The ALC does not appear to function like a canonical Rca; instead, it exerts an effect on the response to CO2 availability at the level of a metabolic module, the carboxysome, through rubisco network formation, and carboxysome organization.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim of the present study was to isolate and characterize a bacterium, strain EN3, capable of using diesel oil as a major carbon and energy source, and to analyse the enhancement of diesel oil degradation by this organism using synthetic mycolic acid (2-hexyl-3-hydroxyldecanoic acid). METHOD AND RESULTS: An actinomycete with the ability to degrade diesel oil was isolated from oil contaminated soil and characterized. The strain had phenotypic properties consistent with its classification in the genus Rhodococcus showing a 16S rRNA gene similarity of 99.7\% with Rhodococcus baikonurensis DSM 44587(T). The ability of the characterized strain to degrade diesel oil at various concentrations (1000, 5000, 10 000 and 20 000 mg l(-1)) was determined. The effect of synthetic mycolic acid on the biodegradation of diesel oil was investigated at the 20 000 mg l(-1) concentration; the surfactant was added to the flask cultures at three different concentrations (10, 50 and 100 mg l(-1)) and degradation followed over 7 days. Enhanced degradation was found at all three concentrations of the surfactant. In addition, the enhancement of diesel oil degradation by other surfactants was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic mycolic acid has potential for the remediation of petroleum-contaminated sites from both an economic and applied perspective as it can stimulate biodegradation at low concentrations. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study showed that the synthesized mycolic acid can be used for potential applications in the bioremediation industries, for example, in oil spill clean-up, diesel fuel remediation and biostimulation.},

It was observed that the degree of catechol modification in PEI-C is 63\%, as determined by the ninhydrin test, preserving the cationic character of the polymer for use in LbL, while mimicking the high catechol content of mussel adhesive proteins at the same time. The study also demonstrated that hyaluronic acid (HA), a linear polysaccharide, was selected for an anionic polymer},

  abstract = {Background: As engineered biological systems become more complex, it is increasingly common to express multiple operons from different plasmids and inducible expression systems within a single host cell. Optimizing such systems often requires screening combinations of origins of replication, expression systems, and antibiotic markers. This procedure is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on how these components behave when more than one origin of replication or expression system are used simultaneously. Additionally, this process can be time consuming as it often requires the creation of new vectors or cloning into existing but disparate vectors.Results: Here, we report the development and characterization of a library of expression vectors compatible with the BglBrick standard (BBF RFC 21). We have designed and constructed 96 BglBrick-compatible plasmids with a combination of replication origins, antibiotic resistance genes, and inducible promoters. These plasmids were characterized over a range of inducer concentrations, in the presence of non-cognate inducer molecules, and with several growth media, and their characteristics were documented in a standard format datasheet. A three plasmid system was used to investigate the impact of multiple origins of replication on plasmid copy number.Conclusions: The standardized collection of vectors presented here allows the user to rapidly construct and test the expression of genes with various combinations of promoter strength, inducible expression system, copy number, and antibiotic resistance. The quantitative datasheets created for these vectors will increase the predictability of gene expression, especially when multiple plasmids and inducers are utilized. © 2011 Lee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {H eat transfer is a basic science that deals with the rate of transfer of ther-mal energy. This introductory text is intended for use in a first course in heat transfer for undergraduate engineering students, and as a reference book for practicing engineers. The objectives of this text are • To cover the basic principles of heat transfer. • To present a wealth of real-world engineering applications to give stu-dents a feel for engineering practice. • To develop an intuitive understanding of the subject matter by empha-sizing the physics and physical arguments. Students are assumed to have completed their basic physics and calculus se-quence. The completion of first courses in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and differential equations prior to taking heat transfer is desirable. The rele-vant concepts from these topics are introduced and reviewed as needed. In engineering practice, an understanding of the mechanisms of heat trans-fer is becoming increasingly important since heat transfer plays a crucial role in the design of vehicles, power plants, refrigerators, electronic devices, build-ings, and bridges, among other things. Even a chef needs to have an intuitive understanding of the heat transfer mechanism in order to cook the food " right " by adjusting the rate of heat transfer. We may not be aware of it, but we al-ready use the principles of heat transfer when seeking thermal comfort. We in-sulate our bodies by putting on heavy coats in winter, and we minimize heat gain by radiation by staying in shady places in summer. We speed up the cool-ing of hot food by blowing on it and keep warm in cold weather by cuddling up and thus minimizing the exposed surface area. That is, we already use heat transfer whether we realize it or not. This text is the outcome of an attempt to have a textbook for a practically ori-ented heat transfer course for engineering students. The text covers the stan-dard topics of heat transfer with an emphasis on physics and real-world applications, while de-emphasizing intimidating heavy mathematical aspects. This approach is more in line with students' intuition and makes learning the subject matter much easier.},

Mutualism evolves most readily between members of different kingdoms, which pool complementary abilities for mutual benefit: some of these mutualisms represent major evolutionary innovations. Mutualism cannot persist if cheating annihilates its benefits. In long-term mutualisms, symbioses, at least one party associates with the other nearly all its life. Usually, a larger host harbours smaller symbionts. Cheating is restrained by vertical transmission, as in Buchnera; partner fidelity, as among bull-thorn acacias and protective ants; test-based choice of symbionts, as bobtail squid choose bioluminescent bacteria; or sanctioning nonperforming symbionts, as legumes punish nonperforming nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Mutualisms involving brief exchanges, as among plants and seed-dispersers, however, persist despite abundant cheating. Both symbioses and brief-exchange mutualisms have transformed whole ecosystems. These mutualisms may be steps towards ecosystems which, like Adam Smith's ideal economy, serve their members' common good.},

  abstract = {This critical review highlights the advances that have been made over recent years in the domain of whole-cell immobilisation and encapsulation for applications relating to the environment and human health, particularly focusing on examples of photosynthetic plant cells, bacteria and algae as well as animal cells. Evidence that encapsulated photosynthetic cells remain active in terms of CO(2) sequestration and biotransformation (solar driven conversion of CO(2) into biofuels, drugs, fine chemicals etc.), coupled with the most recent advances made in the field of cell therapy, reveals the need to develop novel devices based on the preservation of living cells within abiotic porous frameworks. This review shall corroborate this statement by selecting precise examples that unambiguously demonstrate the necessity and the benefits of such smart materials. As will be described, the handling and exploitation of photosynthetic cells are enhanced by entrapment or encapsulation since the cells are physically separated from the liquid medium, thereby facilitating the recovery of the metabolites produced. In the case of animal cells, their encapsulation within a matrix is essential in order to create a physical barrier that can protect the cells auto-immune defenders upon implantation into a living body. For these two research axes, the key parameters that have to be kept in mind when designing hybrid materials will be identified, concentrating on essential aspects such as biocompatibility, mechanical strength and controlled porosity (264 references).},

When the bacteria were dried with 100 mM trehalose, 70\% of the E. coli and 57\% of the B. thuringiensis organisms survived, compared with 56 and 44\%, respectively, when they were dried with sucrose. Only 8\% of the E. coli and 14\% of the B. thuringiensis organisms survived drying without the sugars. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate the role of membrane phase transitions in the survival of the organisms during drying and rehydration. Both E. coli and B. thuringiensis showed an increase of 30 to 40 degrees C in the temperature of their phospholipid phase transition when dried without the sugars, while phase transition temperatures of those dried with the sugars remained near those of the hydrated cells. A Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy microscope made it possible to investigate the effects of drying on the protein structure in the intact cells. The amide II peak shifts from 1,543 cm-1 in the hydrated cells to about 1,533 cm-1 in the cells dried without sugar. There is no shift in the amide II peak when the cells are dried with trehalose or sucrose. We attribute the increased survival to the sugars' ability to lower the membrane phase transition temperature and to protect protein structure in the dry state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The results show that mannose is part of the organic matrix in the SDV. Rhodamine 123, a non-toxic fluorescence laser dye, enters the cell immediately and is trapped in the SDV probably by the high reducing potential of the SDV. Silica is co-deposited with rhodamine 123 in the SDV, and the resulting valves and girdle bands become fluorescent. Implications of this study for the mechanism of silicification are discussed.},

The prepared porous sorbent was characterized by using simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimeter (TG/DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption porosimetry measurement and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Copper ion, Cu(2+), was chosen as the model metal ion to evaluate the effectiveness of the new biosorbent in wastewater treatment. The influence of epoxy-siloxane dose, buffer pH and co-existed ions on Cu(2+) adsorption was assessed through batch experiments. The imprinted composite sorbent offered a fast kinetics for the adsorption of Cu(2+). The uptake capacity of the sorbent imprinted by two pore-building components was higher than those imprinted with only a single component. The dynamic adsorption in column underwent a good elimination of Cu(2+) in treating electric plating wastewater. The prepared composite sorbent exhibited high reusability. Easy preparation of the described porous composite sorbent, absence of organic solvents, cost-effectiveness and high stability make this approach attractive in biosorption.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the biological cell structure, a novel and facile method for preparing organic-inorganic composite microcapsules is developed by a synergy of layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly and biomimetic mineralization. The LBL microcapsule is fabricated by the alternative assembly of a negatively charged polyelectrolyte, poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), and a positively charged biomacromolecule, protamine (Pro), onto calcium carbonate microparticles. An inorganic silica layer is then constructed through a biomimetic mineralization process induced by the outer protamine layer. Catalase is captured in the CaCO(3) templates via co-precipitation and encapsulated in the composite capsules followed by dissolution of the templates. TEM and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observations show that the microcapsules possess a hollow structure and the enzyme inside exists in a free state. The morphology and chemical composition of the microcapsules are characterized by SEM, FTIR and NMR. The dual role of protamine as both a positive layer component and an inducer for silicification provides a simple and efficient approach to form a microbioreactor with a complete, uniform and robust outer shell. Compared to the Pro/PSS LBL microcapsule, the encapsulation efficiency, harsh condition tolerance and long-term storage stability of the encapsulated enzyme are all notably improved due to the shielding effect of the inorganic shell. The fabrication method presented here may provide a general strategy for the preparation of composite materials whose structure of organic membrane and inorganic shell could be easily tuned by varying the LBL and mineralization conditions.},

These merits of thick films produced by LbL assembly can result in new functions and allow the functions of ultrathin films fabricated by LbL assembly to be optimized.

Significant growth retardation in cyanobacteria with glgC knocked out (ΔglgC) has been reported in high light conditions. Here, we knocked out the glgC gene and analyzed its effects on carbon distribution in an isobutanol-producing strain of Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and its parental wild-type strain. We showed that isobutanol production was able to partially rescue the growth of ΔglgC mutant where the growth rescue effect positively correlated with the rate of isobutanol production. Using NaH14CO3 incorporation analysis, we observed a 28 \% loss of total carbon fixation rate in the ΔglgC mutant compared to the wild-type. Upon expression of the isobutanol production pathway in ΔglgC mutant, the total carbon fixation rate was restored to the wild-type level. Furthermore, we showed that 52 \% of the total carbon fixed was redirected into isobutanol biosynthesis in the ΔglgC mutant expressing enzymes for isobutanol production, which is 2.5 times higher than that of the wild-type expressing the same enzymes. These results suggest that biosynthesis of non-native product such as isobutanol can serve as a metabolic sink for replacing glycogen to rescue growth and restore carbon fixation rate. The rescue effect may further serve as a platform for cyanobacteria energy and carbon metabolism study. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

However, there was desorption limitation at 20 kHz ultrasound. Despite of prolonged ultrasonic irradiation, desorption efficiency of TCE did not exceed critical value. And also, the higher percentage of TCE was desorbed when a sample of 2 mg TCE/4 g GAC was treated ultrasonically than that of 2 mg TCE/g GAC under the same experimental conditions.

  abstract = {Background: The feasibility of heterotrophic-phototrophic symbioses was tested via pairing of yeast strains Cryptococcus curvatus, Rhodotorula glutinis, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a sucrose-secreting cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. Results: The phototroph S. elongatus showed no growth in standard BG-11 medium with yeast extract, but grew well in BG-11 medium alone or supplemented with yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB w/o aa). Among three yeast species, C. curvatus and R. glutinis adapted well to the BG-11 medium supplemented with YNB w/o aa, sucrose, and various concentrations of NaCl needed to maintain sucrose secretion from S. elongatus, while growth of S. cerevisiae was highly dependent on sucrose levels. R. glutinis and C. curvatus grew efficiently and utilized sucrose produced by the partner in co-culture. Co-cultures of S. elongatus and R. glutinis were sustained over 1 month in both batch and in semi-continuous culture, with the final biomass and overall lipid yields in the batch co-culture 40 to 60\% higher compared to batch mono-cultures of S. elongatus. The co-cultures showed enhanced levels of palmitoleic and linoleic acids. Furthermore, cyanobacterial growth in co-culture with R. glutinis was significantly superior to axenic growth, as S. elongatus was unable to grow in the absence of the yeast partner when cultivated at lower densities in liquid medium. Accumulated reactive oxygen species was observed to severely inhibit axenic growth of cyanobacteria, which was efficiently alleviated through catalase supply and even more effectively with co-cultures of R. glutinis. Conclusions: The pairing of a cyanobacterium and eukaryotic heterotroph in the artificial lichen of this study demonstrates the importance of mutual interactions between phototrophs and heterotrophs, e.g., phototrophs provide a carbon source to heterotrophs, and heterotrophs assist phototrophic growth and survival by removing/eliminating oxidative stress. Our results establish a potential stable production platform that combines the metabolic capability of photoautotrophs to capture inorganic carbon with the channeling of the resulting organic carbon directly to a robust heterotroph partner for producing biofuel and other chemical precursors.},

  abstract = {Microbes produce a biofilm matrix consisting of proteins, extracellular DNA, and polysaccharides that is integral in the formation of bacterial communities. Historical studies of polysaccharides revealed that their overproduction often alters the colony morphology and can be diagnostic in identifying certain species. The polysaccharide component of the matrix can provide many diverse benefits to the cells in the biofilm, including adhesion, protection, and structure. Aggregative polysaccharides act as molecular glue, allowing the bacterial cells to adhere to each other as well as surfaces. Adhesion facilitates the colonization of both biotic and abiotic surfaces by allowing the bacteria to resist physical stresses imposed by fluid movement that could separate the cells from a nutrient source. Polysaccharides can also provide protection from a wide range of stresses, such as desiccation, immune effectors, and predators such as phagocytic cells and amoebae. Finally, polysaccharides can provide structure to biofilms, allowing stratification of the bacterial community and establishing gradients of nutrients and waste products. This can be advantageous for the bacteria by establishing a heterogeneous population that is prepared to endure stresses created by the rapidly changing environments that many bacteria encounter. The diverse range of polysaccharide structures, properties, and roles highlight the importance of this matrix constituent to the successful adaptation of bacteria to nearly every niche. Here, we present an overview of the current knowledge regarding the diversity and benefits that polysaccharide production provides to bacterial communities within biofilms. INTRODUCTION},

  abstract = {The retention (or release) of a liquid compound on a solid controls the mobility of many substances in the environment and has been quantified in terms of the "sorption isotherm". This paper does not review the different sorption mechanisms. It presents the physical bases underlying the definition of a sorption isotherm, different empirical or mechanistic models, and details several experimental methods to acquire a sorption isotherm. For appropriate measurements and interpretations of isotherm data, this review emphasizes 4 main points: (i) the adsorption (or desorption) isotherm does not provide automatically any information about the reactions involved in the sorption phenomenon. So, mechanistic interpretations must be carefully verified. (ii) Among studies, the range of reaction times is extremely wide and this can lead to misinterpretations regarding the irreversibility of the reaction: a pseudo-hysteresis of the release compared with the retention is often observed. The comparison between the mean characteristic time of the reaction and the mean residence time of the mobile phase in the natural system allows knowing if the studied retention/release phenomenon should be considered as an instantaneous reversible, almost irreversible phenomenon, or if reaction kinetics must be taken into account. (iii) When the concentration of the retained substance is low enough, the composition of the bulk solution remains constant and a single-species isotherm is often sufficient, although it remains strongly dependent on the background medium. At higher concentrations, sorption may be driven by the competition between several species that affect the composition of the bulk solution. (iv) The measurement method has a great influence. Particularly, the background ionic medium, the solid/solution ratio and the use of flow-through or closed reactor are of major importance. The chosen method should balance easy-to-use features and representativity of the studied natural conditions. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this research was to create a CO\textsubscript{2}‐driven syntrophic consortium for the catalytic conversion of renewable biomass‐derived 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to FDCA. Sucrose produced from carbon fixation by the engineered \emph{Synechococcus elongatus} served as the sole carbon source for the engineered \emph{Pseudomonas putida} to catalyze the reaction of HMF to FDCA. The yield of FDCA by the consortium reached around 70\% while the conversion of HMF was close to 100\%. With further surface engineering to clump the two strains, the FDCA yield was elevated to almost 100\% via the specific association between an SH3 domain and its ligand.

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are attractive microbial hosts for production of chemicals using light and CO2. However, their low productivity of chemicals is a major challenge for commercial applications. This is mostly due to their relatively slow growth rate and carbon partitioning toward biomass rather than products. Many cyanobacterial strains synthesize sucrose as an osmoprotectant to cope with salt stress environments. In this study, we harnessed the photosynthetic machinery of the fast-growing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 to produce sucrose under salt stress conditions and investigated if the high efficiency of photosynthesis can enhance the productivity of sucrose. By expressing the sucrose transporter CscB, Synechococcus 2973 produced 8 g L−1 of sucrose with a highest productivity of 1.9 g L−1 day−1 under salt stress conditions. The salt stress activated the sucrose biosynthetic pathway mostly via upregulating the sps gene, which encodes the rate-limiting sucrose-phosphate synthase enzyme. To alleviate the demand on high concentrations of salt for sucrose production, we further overexpressed the sucrose synthesis genes in Synechococcus 2973. The engineered strain produced sucrose with a productivity of 1.1 g L−1 day−1 without the need of salt induction. The engineered Synechococcus 2973 in this study demonstrated the highest productivity of sucrose in cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Detergents are used in molecular biology laboratories every day. They are present in cell lysis buffers (e.g., in kits for plasmid isolation), in electrophoresis and blotting buffers, and, most importantly, they are used for cleaning laboratory glassware and the hands of the laboratory staff. For these routine applications, a detailed knowledge of detergent properties is not necessary-they just work. When it comes to the isolation and purification of membrane proteins, one cannot rely on routine protocols. Many membrane proteins are only stable in a small number of different detergent buffer systems, and worst of all, different membrane proteins prefer very different detergents. Unfortunately, detergent properties are considered the domain of colloid science or physical chemistry, and thus, while the available amount of physico-chemical data on detergents is astounding, this data is rarely compiled in a way that is useful to biochemists. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the physical and chemical properties of detergents commonly used in membrane protein science and to explain how these properties can be exploited for protein purification. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Living systems, such as bacteria, yeasts, and mammalian cells, can be genetically programmed with synthetic circuits that execute sensing, computing, memory, and response functions. Integrating these functional living components into materials and devices will provide powerful tools for scientific research and enable new technological applications. However, it has been a grand challenge to maintain the viability, functionality, and safety of living components in freestanding materials and devices, which frequently undergo deformations during applications. Here, we report the design of a set of living materials and devices based on stretchable, robust, and biocompatible hydrogel-elastomer hybrids that host various types of genetically engineered bacterial cells. The hydrogel provides sustainable supplies of water and nutrients, and the elastomer is air-permeable, maintaining long-term viability and functionality of the encapsulated cells. Communication between different bacterial strains and with the environment is achieved via diffusion of molecules in the hydrogel. The high stretchability and robustness of the hydrogel-elastomer hybrids prevent leakage of cells from the living materials and devices, even under large deformations. We show functions and applications of stretchable living sensors that are responsive to multiple chemicals in a variety of form factors, including skin patches and gloves-based sensors. We further develop a quantitative model that couples transportation of signaling molecules and cellular response to aid the design of future living materials and devices.},

  abstract = {We present NUFEB (Newcastle University Frontiers in Engineering Biology), a flexible, efficient, and open source software for simulating the 3D dynamics of microbial communities. The tool is based on the Individual-based Modelling (IbM) approach, where microbes are represented as discrete units and their behaviour changes over time due to a variety of processes. This approach allows us to study population behaviours that emerge from the interaction between individuals and their environment. NUFEB is built on top of the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), which we extended with IbM features. A wide range of biological, physical and chemical processes are implemented to explicitly model microbial systems, with particular emphasis on biofilms. NUFEB is fully parallelised and allows for the simulation of large numbers of microbes (107 individuals and beyond). The parallelisation is based on a domain decomposition scheme that divides the domain into multiple sub-domains which are distributed to different processors. NUFEB also offers a collection of post-processing routines for the visualisation and analysis of simulation output. In this article, we give an overview of NUFEB’s functionalities and implementation details. We provide examples that illustrate the type of microbial systems NUFEB can be used to model and simulate.},

Firstly, PCP in water was adsorbed onto GAC, then the PCP was decomposed and GAC regenerated by MW irradiation. The liquid and gas produced during irradiation were collected through condensing, and absorbed by a 0.1 moll-1 NaOH solution, respectively. The determination of the PCP concentrations in the distillate, absorption solution and GAC was accomplished by a HPLC. The results suggested that when irradiated with 850 W MW for 10 min, most of the PCP adsorbed by GAC and whatever fragments formed were decomposed to CO2, H2O and HCl or tightly bound to GAC, and less than 2\% of PCP was transformed into intermediates in the distillate. Some dechlorination and dehydroxylation products were identified by the GC/MS analysis, and the degradation mechanism was proposed. It was also confirmed that GAC could be reused after several adsorption/MW regeneration cycles and its adsorption capacity could maintain a relatively high level, even higher than that of virgin GAC, as indicated by BET results, iodine values and PCP adsorption isotherms. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The integrity of the cell membranes of both species and the permeabilities of the outer membrane (OM) and inner membrane (IM) of E. coli were investigated by determining the release from cells of materials that absorb at 260 nm, changes in the fluorescence of cells treated with the fluorescent probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) and release of cytoplasmic ??-galactosidase activity. In addition, the interaction of CS with synthetic phospholipid membranes was studied using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), UV-VIS spectrophotometery, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermal analysis. Results showed that CS increased the permeability of the OM and IM and ultimately disrupted bacterial cell membranes, with the release of cellular contents. This damage was likely caused by the electrostatic interaction between NH3+ groups of CS acetate and phosphoryl groups of phospholipid components of cell membranes. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {So far, the first- and second-order kinetic equations have been most frequently employed to interpret adsorption data obtained under various conditions, whereas the theoretical origins of these two equations still remain unknown. Using the Langmuir kinetics as a theoretical basis, this study showed that the Langmuir kinetics can be transformed to a polynomial expression of dtheta t /d t = k 1(theta e - theta t ) + k 2(theta e - theta t ) (2), a varying-order rate equation. The sufficient and necessary conditions for simplification of the Langmuir kinetics to the first- and second-order rate equations were put forward, which suggested that the relative magnitude of theta e over k 1/ k 2 governs the simplification of the Langmuir kinetics. In cases where k 1/ k 2 is greater than theta e or k 1/ k 2 is very close to theta e, adsorption kinetics would be reasonably described by the first-order rate equation, whereas the Langmuir kinetics would be reduced to the second-order equation only at k 1/ k 2 {$<<$} theta e. It was further demonstrated that both theta e and k 1/ k 2 are the function of initial adsorbate concentration ( C 0) at a given dosage of adsorbent, indicating that simplification of the Langmuir kinetics indeed is determined by C 0. Detailed C 0-depedent boundary conditions for simplifying the Langmuir kinetics were also established and were verified by experimental data.},

Functional heterologous expression of the alkB gene was achieved in Pseudomonas fluorescens KOB2delta1. Recombinant Pseudomonas containing the alkB gene of Alcanivorax sp. strain 2B5 recovered the ability to grow on C(14) and C(16)n-alkanes. RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of the alkB gene was induced by octadecane. There could be other alkane hydroxylases in Alcanivorax sp. 2B5 that could be involved in the degradation of short- and long-chain alkanes.},

  abstract = {Poly (vinyl alcohol)/Gelatin hydrogels are under active investigation as potential vascular cell culture biomaterials, tissue models and vascular implants. The PVA/Gelatin hydrogels are physically crosslinked by the freeze-thaw technique, which is followed by a coagulation bath treatment. In this study, the thermal behavior of the gels was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Rheological measurement and uniaxial tensile tests revealed key mechanical properties. The role of polymer fraction in relation to these mechanical properties is explored. Gelatin has no significant effect on the thermal behavior of PVA, which indicates that no substantial change occurs in the PVA crystallite due to the presence of gelatin. The glass transition temperature, melting temperature, degree of crystallinity, polymer fraction, storage modulus (G???) and ultimate strength of one freeze-thaw cycle (1FT) hydrogels are inferior to those of 3FT hydrogels. With coagulation, both 1FT and 3FT hydrogels shifted to a lower value of Tg, melting temperature and polymer fraction are further increased and the degree of crystallinity is depressed. The mechanical properties of 1FT, but not 3FT, were strengthened with coagulation treatment. This study gives a detailed investigation of the microstructure formation of PVA/Gelatin hydrogel in each stage of physical treatments which helps us to explain the role of physical treatments in tuning their physical properties for biomechanical applications. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:'Chlorochromatium aggregatum' is a phototrophic consortium, a symbiosis that may represent the highest degree of mutual interdependence between two unrelated bacteria not associated with a eukaryotic host. 'Chlorochromatium aggregatum' is a motile, barrel-shaped aggregate formed from a single cell of 'Candidatus Symbiobacter mobilis", a polarly flagellated, non-pigmented, heterotrophic bacterium, which is surrounded by approximately 15 epibiont cells of Chlorobium chlorochromatii, a non-motile photolithoautotrophic green sulfur bacterium.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS:We analyzed the complete genome sequences of both organisms to understand the basis for this symbiosis. Chl. chlorochromatii has acquired relatively few symbiosis-specific genes; most acquired genes are predicted to modify the cell wall or function in cell-cell adhesion. In striking contrast, 'Ca. S. mobilis' appears to have undergone massive gene loss, is probably no longer capable of independent growth, and thus may only reproduce when consortia divide. A detailed model for the energetic and metabolic bases of the dependency of 'Ca. S. mobilis' on Chl. chlorochromatii is described.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS:Genomic analyses suggest that three types of interactions lead to a highly sophisticated relationship between these two organisms. Firstly, extensive metabolic exchange, involving carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur sources as well as vitamins, occurs from the epibiont to the central bacterium. Secondly, 'Ca. S. mobilis' can sense and move towards light and sulfide, resources that only directly benefit the epibiont. Thirdly, electron cycling mechanisms, particularly those mediated by quinones and potentially involving shared protonmotive force, could provide an important basis for energy exchange in this and other symbiotic relationships.},

  abstract = {Interspecies interactions are essential for the persistence and development of any kind of complex community, and microbial biofilms are no exception. Multispecies biofilms are structured and spatially defined communities that have received much attention due to their omnipresence in natural environments. Species residing in these complex bacterial communities usually interact both intra- and interspecifically. Such interactions are considered to not only be fundamental in shaping overall biomass and the spatial distribution of cells residing in multispecies biofilms, but also to result in coordinated regulation of gene expression in the different species present. These communal interactions often lead to emergent properties in biofilms, such as enhanced tolerance against antibiotics, host immune responses, and other stresses, which have been shown to provide benefits to all biofilm members not only the enabling sub- populations. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of cellular processes affecting spatial organization, and vice versa, are poorly understood and very complex to unravel. Therefore, detailed description of the spatial organization of individual bacterial cells in multispecies communities can be an alternative strategy to reveal the nature of interspecies interactions of constituent species. Closing the gap between visual observation and biological processes may become crucial for resolving biofilm related problems, which is of utmost importance to environmental, industrial, and clinical implications. This review briefly presents the state of the art of studying interspecies interactions and spatial organization of multispecies communities, aiming to support theoretical and practical arguments for further advancement of this field},

  abstract = {The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is used as a model organism to study photosynthesis, as it can utilize glucose as the sole carbon source to support its growth under heterotrophic conditions. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) has been widely applied to repress the transcription of genes in a targeted manner in cyanobacteria. However, a robust and reversible induced CRISPRi system has not been explored in Synechocystis 6803 to knock down and recover the expression of a targeted gene. In this study, we built a tightly controlled chimeric promoter, PrhaBAD-RSW, in which a theophylline responsive riboswitch was integrated into a rhamnose-inducible promoter system. We applied this promoter to drive the expression of ddCpf1 (DNase-dead Cpf1 nuclease) in a CRISPRi system and chose the PSII reaction center gene psbD (D2 protein) to target for repression. psbD was specifically knocked down by over 95\% of its native expression, leading to severely inhibited photosystem II activity and growth of Synechocystis 6803 under photoautotrophic conditions. Significantly, removal of the inducers rhamnose and theophylline reversed repression by CRISPRi. Expression of PsbD recovered following release of repression, coupled with increased photosystem II content and activity. This reversibly induced CRISPRi system in Synechocystis 6803 represents a new strategy for study of the biogenesis of photosynthetic complexes in cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Abstract Since the early 1990s, there has been great interest in the synthesis and characterisation of the family of ordered mesoporous materials. Much of this work has been devoted to silica-based solids, prepared with organic micelles as structure directing agents. Some of these materials can be considered as references for physisorption studies, notably to explore capillary condensation phenomena. Indeed, various well-defined structures can be prepared allowing adsorption in cylinders, 3D tubular pores and cage-like pores to be studied. Some solids have been functionalised to adsorb specific gases and can be used as templates to prepare other materials (oxides, carbons, etc.). Furthermore, this micelle template synthesis route is used to prepare ordered mesoporous organosilicas and carbons. This chapter aims to highlight some of the progress made in understanding adsorption in these ordered mesoporous materials. Some insights into the adsorption properties of samples derived from these silicas will also be given.},

  abstract = {The mode of interaction of the polycationic aminoglycoside antibiotics with the surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells was studied with the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN). The addition of the aminoglycoside gentamicin to intact cells in the presence of NPN led to a shift in the fluorescence emission maximum from 460 to 420 nm. At the same time the NPN fluorescence intensity increased fourfold. Gentamicin caused no such effects when added to outer membrane vesicles, suggesting that the increased fluorescence resulted from the interaction of gentamicin with intact cells. Gentamicin-promoted NPN uptake was inhibited by the divalent cations Mg2+ and Ca2+, but occurred in the absence of gentamicin transport across the inner membrane. Low concentrations of gentamicin (2 micrograms/ml) caused NPN fluorescence to increase over a period of 4 min in a sigmoidal fashion. At higher concentrations (50 micrograms/ml) the increase occurred within a few seconds. The final fluorescence intensity was almost independent of the gentamicin concentration. A centrifugation technique was used to demonstrate that gentamicin caused actual uptake of NPN from the supernatant. The initial rate of NPN uptake varied according to the gentamicin concentration in a sigmoidal fashion. Similar data were obtained for seven other aminoglycoside antibiotics. The data, when reanalyzed as a Hill plot, gave a series of lines with a mean slope (the Hill number) of 2.26 +/- 0.26, suggesting that the interaction of aminoglycosides with the cell surface to permeabilize it to NPN involved at least three sites and demonstrated positive cooperativity. There was a statistically significant relationship between the pseudoassociation constant K, from the Hill plots and the minimal inhibitory concentrations for the eight antibiotics. These results are consistent with the concept that aminoglycosides interact as a divalent cation binding site on the P. aeruginosa outer membrane and permeabilize it to the hydrophobic prove NPN.},

As ever-expanding multi-omic data sets become available, their potential utility in transforming theory into practice remains firmly rooted in the underlying quantitative principles that govern biological systems.

We developed two versions of controller, both of which have glucose nutrient sensors but differ in their substrate-sensing modules. One controller is specific for hydroxycinnamic acid and the other for oleic acid. Our hydroxycinnamic acid controller lowered metabolic stress 2-fold and increased the growth rate 2-fold and productivity 5-fold, whereas our oleic acid controller lowered metabolic stress 2-fold and increased the growth rate 1.3-fold and productivity 2.4-fold. These results demonstrate the potential for engineering strategies that decouple growth and production to make bio-based production more economical and sustainable.},

  abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) holds great potential for studying the nanoscale surface structures of living cells, and to measure their interactions with abiotic surfaces, other cells, or specific biomolecules. However, the application of AFM in microbiology is challenging due to the difficulty of immobilising bacterial cells to a flat surface without changing the cell surface properties or cell viability. We have performed an extensive and thorough study of how to functionalise surfaces in order to immobilise living bacteria for AFM studies in liquid environments. Our aim was to develop a scheme which allows bacterial cells to be immobilised to a flat surface with sufficient strength to avoid detachment during the AFM scanning, and without affecting cell surface chemistry, structure, and viability. We compare and evaluate published methods, and present a new, reproducible, and generally applicable scheme for immobilising bacteria cells for an AFM imaging.Bacterial cells were immobilised to modified glass surfaces by physical confinement of cells in microwells, physisorption to positively charged surfaces, covalent binding to amine- or carboxyl-terminated surfaces, and adsorption to surfaces coated with highly adhesive polyphenolic proteins originating from the mussel Mytilus edulis. Living cells could be immobilised with all of these approaches, but many cells detached when immobilised by electrostatic interactions and imaged in buffers like PBS or MOPS. Cells were more firmly attached when immobilised by covalent binding, although some cells still detached during AFM imaging. The most successful method revealed was immobilisation by polyphenolic proteins, which facilitated firm immobilisation of the cells. Furthermore, the cell viability was not affected by this immobilisation scheme, and adhesive proteins thus provide a fast, reproducible, and generally applicable scheme for immobilising living bacteria for an AFM imaging. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Background: One of the major challenges for the present and future generations is to find suitable substitutes for the fossil resources we rely on today. Cyanobacterial carbohydrates have been discussed as an emerging renewable feedstock in industrial biotechnology for the production of fuels and chemicals, showing promising production rates when compared to crop-based feedstock. However, intrinsic capacities of cyanobacteria to produce biotechnological compounds are limited and yields are low. Results: Here, we present an approach to circumvent these problems by employing a synthetic bacterial co-culture for the carbon-neutral production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from CO2. The co-culture consists of two bio-modules: Bio-module I, in which the cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus elongatus cscB fixes CO2, converts it to sucrose, and exports it into the culture supernatant; and bio-module II, where this sugar serves as C-source for Pseudomonas putida cscAB and is converted to PHAs that are accumulated in the cytoplasm. By applying a nitrogen-limited process, we achieved a maximal PHA production rate of 23.8 mg/(L day) and a maximal titer of 156 mg/L. We will discuss the present shortcomings of the process and show the potential for future improvement. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the feasibility of mixed cultures of S. elongatus cscB and P. putida cscAB for PHA production, making room for the cornucopia of possible products that are described for P. putida. The construction of more efficient sucrose-utilizing P. putida phenotypes and the optimization of process conditions will increase yields and productivities and eventually close the gap in the contemporary process. In the long term, the co-culture may serve as a platform process, in which P. putida is used as a chassis for the implementation of synthetic metabolic pathways for biotechnological production of value-added products.},

  abstract = {Classical biochemistry is founded on several assumptions valid in dilute aqueous solutions that are often extended without question to the interior milieu of intact cells. In the first section of this chapter, we present these assumptions and briefly examine the ways in which the cell interior may depart from the conditions of an ideal solution. In the second section, we summarize experimental evidence regarding the physical properties of the cell cytoplasm and their effect on the diffusion and binding of macromolecules and vesicles. While many details remain to be worked out, it is clear that the aqueous phase of the cytoplasm is crowded rather than dilute, and that the diffusion and partitioning of macromolecules and vesicles in cytoplasm is highly restricted by steric hindrance as well as by unexpected binding interactions. Furthermore, the enzymes of several metabolic pathways are now known to be organized into structural and functional units with specific localizations in the solid phase, and as much as half the cellular protein content may also be in the solid phase.},

Silicates, primarily in the form of sol-gel composites or functionalized mesoporous silica, have been used to encapsulate a wide variety of biomolecules but the harsh conditions required for chemical synthesis limit their applicability. Silaffin polypeptides from diatoms catalyze the formation of silica in vitro at neutral pH and ambient temperature and pressure. Here we show that butyrylcholinesterase entrapped during the precipitation of silica nanospheres retained all of its activity. Ninety percent of the soluble enzyme was immobilized, and the immobilized enzyme was substantially more stable than the free enzyme. The mechanical properties of silica nanospheres facilitated application in a flow-through reactor. The use of biosilica for enzyme immobilization combines the excellent support properties of a silica matrix with a benign immobilization method that retains enzyme activity.},

A functionalized composite material is described herein, that combines in situ immobilized alkane-degrading bacteria with an adsorbent material that collects hydrocarbon substrates, and facilitates biodegradation by the immobilized bacterial population. Acinetobacter venetianus 2AW was isolated for its ability to utilize hydrophobic n-alkanes (C10-C18) as the sole carbon and energy source. Growth of strain 2AW also resulted in the production of a biosurfactant that aided in the dispersion of complex mixtures of hydrophobic compounds. Effective immobilization of strain 2AW to the surface of Ottimat™ adsorbent hair mats via vapor phase deposition of silica provided a stable and reproducible biocatalyst population that facilitates in situ biodegradation of n-alkanes. Silica-immobilized strain 2AW demonstrated ca. 85\% removal of 1\% (v/v) tetradecane and hexadecane within 24 h, under continuous flow conditions. The methodology for immobilizing whole bacterial cells at the surface of an adsorbent, for in situ degradation of hydrocarbons, has practical application in the bioremediation of oil in water emulsions.

  abstract = {Biocatalytic reactions performed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are interesting in pharmaceutical research since they are involved in human drug metabolism. Furthermore, they are potentially interesting as biocatalysts for synthetic chemistry because of the exquisite selectivity of the chemistry they undertake. For example, selective hydroxylation can be undertaken on a highly functionalized molecule without the need for functional group protection. Recent progress in the discovery of novel P450s as well as protein engineering of these enzymes strongly encourages further development of their application, including use in synthetic processes. The biological characteristics of P450s (e.g., cofactor dependence) motivate the use of whole-cell systems for synthetic processes, and those processes implemented in industry are so far dominated by growing cells and native host systems. However, for an economically feasible process, the expression of P450 systems in a heterologous host with sufficient biocatalyst yield (g/g cdw) for non-growing systems or space-time yield (g/L/h) for growing systems remains a major challenge. This review summarizes the opportunities to improve P450 whole-cell processes and strategies in order to apply and implement them in industrial processes, both from a biological and process perspective. Indeed, a combined approach of host selection and cell engineering, integrated with process engineering, is suggested as the most effective route to implementation.},

This review provides a summary of the recent occurrence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment including sewage, surface water, groundwater and drinking water. The discharge of treated effluent from WWTPs is a major pathway for the introduction of micropollutants to surface water. WWTPs act as primary barriers against the spread of micropollutants. WWTP removal efficiency of the selected micropollutants in 14 countries/regions depicts compound-specific variation in removal, ranging from 12.5 to 100\%. Advanced treatment processes, such as activated carbon adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and membrane bioreactors can achieve higher and more consistent micropollutant removal. However, regardless of what technology is employed, the removal of micropollutants depends on physico-chemical properties of micropollutants and treatment conditions. The evaluation of micropollutant removal from municipal wastewater should cover a series of aspects from sources to end uses. After the release of micropollutants, a better understanding and modeling of their fate in surface water is essential for effectively predicting their impacts on the receiving environment. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

A screen of P. putida F1 mutants, each lacking one of the genes encoding the 18 putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), revealed that pcaY encodes the MCP required for metabolism-independent chemotaxis to vanillate, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzoate, benzoate, protocatechuate, quinate, shikimate, as well as 10 substituted benzoates that do not serve as growth substrates for P. putida F1. Chemotaxis was induced during growth on aromatic compounds, and an analysis of a pcaY-lacZ fusion revealed that pcaY is expressed in the presence of β-ketoadipate, a common intermediate in the pathway. pcaY expression also required the transcriptional activator PcaR, indicating that pcaY is a member of the pca regulon, which includes three unlinked gene clusters that encode five enzymes required for the conversion of 4-hydroxybenzoate to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates as well as the major facilitator superfamily transport protein PcaK. The 4-hydroxybenzoate permease PcaK was shown to modulate the chemotactic response by facilitating the uptake of 4-hydroxybenzoate, which leads to the accumulation of β-ketoadipate, thereby increasing pcaY expression. The results show that chemotaxis, transport and metabolism of aromatic compounds are intimately linked in P. putida.},

The deletion of multiple residues, up to six amino acids, did not fatally abolish its specific degradation activity, instead of being able to improve the stability of the tagged protein in the presence of endogenous proteases before mf-Lon expression in E. coli. Except for previously identified essential residues, the region adjacent to the C-terminal of the mf-ssrA tag was involved in mf-Lon and endogenous protease-mediated degradation. Moreover, the deletion of specific residues made the mf-ssrA tag more effective and compact.

  abstract = {Carboxysomes are protein-based organelles that are essential for allowing cyanobacteria to fix CO2. Previously, we identified a two-component system, McdAB, responsible for equidistantly positioning carboxysomes in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (MacCready JS, Hakim P, Young EJ, Hu L, Liu J, Osteryoung KW, Vecchiarelli AG, Ducat DC. 2018. Protein gradients on the nucleoid position the carbon-fixing organelles of cyanobacteria. eLife 7:pii:e39723). McdA, a ParA-type ATPase, nonspecifically binds the nucleoid in the presence of ATP. McdB, a novel factor that directly binds carboxysomes, displaces McdA from the nucleoid. Removal of McdA from the nucleoid in the vicinity of carboxysomes by McdB causes a global break in McdA symmetry, and carboxysome motion occurs via a Brownian-ratchet-based mechanism toward the highest concentration of McdA. Despite the importance for cyanobacteria to properly position their carboxysomes, whether the McdAB system is widespread among cyanobacteria remains an open question. Here, we show that the McdAB system is widespread among β-cyanobacteria, often clustering with carboxysome-related components, and is absent in α-cyanobacteria. Moreover, we show that two distinct McdAB systems exist in β-cyanobacteria, with Type 2 systems being the most ancestral and abundant, and Type 1 systems, like that of S. elongatus, possibly being acquired more recently. Lastly, all McdB proteins share the sequence signatures of a protein capable of undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation. Indeed, we find that representatives of both McdB types undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, the first example of a ParA-type ATPase partner protein to exhibit this behavior. Our results have broader implications for understanding carboxysome evolution, biogenesis, homeostasis, and positioning in cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Carboxysomes are protein-based bacterial organelles encapsulating key enzymes of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Previous work has implicated a ParA-like protein (hereafter McdA) as important for spatially organizing carboxysomes along the longitudinal axis of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Yet, how self-organization of McdA emerges and contributes to carboxysome positioning is unknown. Here, we identify a small protein, termed McdB that localizes to carboxysomes and drives emergent oscillatory patterning of McdA on the nucleoid. Our results demonstrate that McdB directly stimulates McdA ATPase activity and its release from DNA, driving carboxysome-dependent depletion of McdA locally on the nucleoid and promoting directed motion of carboxysomes towards increased concentrations of McdA. We propose that McdA and McdB are a previously unknown class of self-organizing proteins that utilize a Brownian-ratchet mechanism to position carboxysomes in cyanobacteria, rather than a cytoskeletal system. These results have broader implications for understanding spatial organization of protein mega-complexes and organelles in bacteria.Cyanobacteria are tiny organisms that can harness the energy of the sun to power their cells. Many of the tools required for this complex photosynthetic process are packaged into small compartments inside the cell, the carboxysomes. In Synechococcus elongatus, a cyanobacterium that is shaped like a rod, the carboxysomes are positioned at regular intervals along the length of the cell. This ensures that, when the bacterium splits itself in half to reproduce, both daughter cells have the same number of carboxysomes.Researchers know that, in S. elongatus, a protein called McdA can oscillate from one end of the cell to the other. This protein is responsible for the carboxysomes being in the right place, and some scientists believe that it helps to create an internal skeleton that anchors and drags the compartments into position.Here, MacCready et al. propose another mechanism and, by combining various approaches, identify a new partner for McdA. This protein, called McdB, is present on the carboxysomes. McdB also binds to McdA, which itself attaches to the nucleoid – the region in the cell that contains the DNA. McdB forces McdA to release itself from DNA, causing the protein to reposition itself along the nucleoid. Because McdB attaches to McdA, the carboxysomes then follow suit, constantly seeking the highest concentrations of McdA bound to nearby DNA. Instead of relying on a cellular skeleton, these two proteins can organize themselves on their own using the nucleoid as a scaffold; in turn, they distribute carboxysomes evenly along the length of a cell.Plants also obtain their energy from the sun via photosynthesis, but they do not carry carboxysomes. Scientists have tried to introduce these compartments inside plant cells, hoping that it could generate crops with higher yields. Knowing how carboxysomes are organized so they can be passed down from one generation to the next could be important for these experiments.},

The oscillatory patterns of the Min-system proteins MinC, MinD and MinE (MinCDE) are strongly dependent on the geometry of membranes they bind. Complex internal membranes within cyanobacteria could disrupt this self-organization by sterically occluding or sequestering MinCDE from the plasma membrane. Here, it was shown that the Min system in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 oscillates from pole-to-pole despite the potential spatial constraints imposed by their extensive thylakoid network. Moreover, reaction-diffusion simulations predict robust oscillations in modeled cyanobacterial cells provided that thylakoid network permeability is maintained to facilitate diffusion, and suggest that Min proteins require preferential affinity for the plasma membrane over thylakoids to correctly position the FtsZ ring. Interestingly, in addition to oscillating, MinC exhibits a midcell localization dependent on MinD and the DivIVA-like protein Cdv3, indicating that two distinct pools of MinC are coordinated in S. elongatus. Our results provide the first direct evidence for Min oscillation outside of E. coli and have broader implications for Min-system function in bacteria and organelles with internal membrane systems.},

The resulting properties of the Ormosils are then governed by the type and concentration of organics used. Examples are presented in which the mechanical, electrical and optical properties of selected Ormosils can be influenced by organic groups. For instance, small amounts of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) added to a solution of TEOS will give an Ormosil about ten times harder than the hardest organic polymer. Larger amounts of PDMS (20\%) will now yield an Ormosil which is as rubbery as organic rubber. Ormosils in which the organic and inorganic constituents are covalently bound to each other are the focus of this critical review. The potential applications of such Ormosils are discussed.},

Introduction of two or more chlorine atoms ortho to the Ph-Ph bond results in a hipsochromic shift of K band and diminished xi value due to steric inhibition of resonance between the two phenyl rings. The sterically hindered chlorobiphenyls and the more highly chlorinated Aroclors also exhibit a series of low-intensity fine-structured absorption maxima between 268-302 nm.

  abstract = {Background: The light-driven consortia consisted of sucrose-secreting cyanobacteria and heterotrophic species capable of producing valuable chemicals have recently attracted significant attention, and are considered as a promising strategy for green biomanufacturing. In a previous study (Zhang et al, 2020, Biotechnol Biofuel, 13:82), we achieved a one-step conversion of CO2 through sucrose derived from cyanobacteria to fine chemicals by constructing an artificial co-culture system consisting of sucrose-secreting Synechococcus elongateus cscB+ and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) producing Escherichia coli ABKm. Analysis of the co-culture system showed that cyanobacterial cells were growing better than its corresponding axenic culture. To explore the underlaid mechanism and to identify the metabolic modules to further improve the co-culture system, an integrated metabolomics, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was conducted.Results: We first explored the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on cyanobacterial cell growth under co-culture system by supplementing additional ascorbic acid to scavenge ROS in CoBG-11 medium. The result showed cyanobacterial growth was obviously improved with additional 1 mM ascorbic acid under pure culture; however, cyanobacterial growth was still slower than that in the co-culture with E. coli, suggesting that the better growth of Synechococcus cscB+ might be caused by other factors more than just ROS quenching. We then investigated the intracellular metabolite levels in cyanobacteria using LC-MS based metabolomics analysis. The results showed that metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism were increased, suggesting more carbon sources were utilized by cyanobacteria in the co-culture system, which illuminating that enhanced photosynthesis attributes to the higher CO2 availability produced from co-cultivated heterotrophic partner. To further explore the interaction based on cross-feeding and metabolite exchange, quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics were applied to Synechococcus cscB+. Analysis of differentially regulated genes/proteins showed that the higher availability of carbon, nitrogen, phosphate, calcium, Cu2+, Fe3+ and co-factors was observed in co-cultivated Synechococcus cscB+ during co-cultivation, suggesting the heterotrophic partner in the system might be involved in supplementing CO2 and improving essential micronutrients necessary to maintain high photosynthetic growth of Synechococcus cscB+. Conclusion: Integrated omics analysis of the interaction mechanism between S. elongateus and E. coli showed metabolic changes such as enhanced photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, essential micronutrients, and the ROS scavenging occurred at multiple levels of genes, proteins and metabolites, which might be together contributing to the better cell growth of Synechococcus cscB+ in co-cultivation. In addition, the results implicated that the co-culture system could be further improved by engineering the modules related to the ROS quenching, carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, Pi transport, metal transport and co-factors biosynthesis. Finally, the light condition, which may influence the cross-feeding metabolites between phototrophic and heterotrophic species, and also affect the oxidative pressure on the E. coli strains due to the photosynthesis, could be further optimized to improve cell growth in the co-culture system, eventually leading to high productivity of value-added products.},

Polymers containing the trehalose pendent groups were prepared via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization using two different thiol-reactive chain transfer agents (CTAs) for subsequent conjugation to proteins through disulfide linkages. The resulting glycopolymers were well-defined, and a range of molecular weights from 4200 to 49\,500 Da was obtained. The polymers were conjugated to thiolated hen egg white lysozyme and purified. The glycopolymers when added or covalently attached to protein significantly increased stability toward lyophilization and heat relative to wild-type protein. Up to 100\% retention of activity was observed when lysozyme was stressed ten times with lyophilization and 81\% activity when the protein was heated at 90 °C for 1 h; this is in contrast to 16\% and 18\% retention of activity, respectively, for the wild-type protein alone. The glycopolymers were compared to equivalent concentrations of trehalose and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and found to be superior at stabilizing the protein to lyophilization and heat.

The LC-50×NSP-35 column combination resulted in an average absolute percent difference of 33.8\%, 62.2\% and 30.8\% compared to the NIST certified PAH concentrations for NIST SRM1650b, NIST SRM1975 with cleanup and NIST SRM1975 without cleanup, while the Rtx-5ms×Rxi-17 resulted in an absolute percent difference of 38.6\%, 67.2\% and 79.6\% for NIST SRM1650b, NIST SRM1975 with cleanup and NIST SRM1975 without cleanup, respectively. This GC×GC/ToF-MS method increases the number of PAHs detected and quantified in complex environmental extracts using a single chromatographic run. Without clean-up, 7 additional compounds were detected and quantified in NIST SRM1975 using the LC-50×NSP-35 column combination. These results suggest that the use of the LC-50×NSP-35 column combination in GC×GC/ToF-MS not only results in better chromatographic resolution and greater orthogonality for the separation of complex PAH mixtures, but can also be used for the accurate quantification of complex PAH mixtures in environmental extracts, such as diesel particulate matter, without silica gel cleanup.},

Concerning the eight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which define three classes, we found that Synechocystis can survive in the absence of one but not two PBPs of either class A or class C, whereas the unique class B PBP (also termed FtsI) is indispensable. Furthermore, we showed that all three classes of PBPs are required for normal cell size. Similarly, the putative FtsQ and FtsW proteins appeared to be required for viability and normal cell size. We also used a suitable bacterial two-hybrid system to characterize the interaction web among the eight PBPs, FtsQ, and FtsW, as well as ZipN, the crucial FtsZ partner that occurs only in cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts. We showed that FtsI, FtsQ, and ZipN are self-interacting proteins and that both FtsI and FtsQ interact with class A PBPs, as well as with ZipN. Collectively, these findings indicate that ZipN, in interacting with FtsZ and both FtsI and FtQ, plays a similar role to the Escherichia coli FtsA protein, which is missing in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.},

  abstract = {Inactivation of ccmO in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 resulted in a mutant which possesses aberrant carboxysomes and a normal inorganic carbon uptake capability but a reduced ability to photosynthetically utilize the internal inorganic carbon pool. Consequently, it exhibits low apparent photosynthetic affinity for extracellular inorganic carbon and demands high levels of CO2 for growth. Cyanobacterial mutants which cannot grow under different levels of CO2 are being used for the elucidation of the physiological and molecular bases of the inorganic carbon (Ci)-concentrating mechanism (1-4, 6-14, 16-18, 20). Some of these mutants show a total lack of carboxysomes or possess aberrant forms of these bodies, which contain most of the rubisco and carbonic anhydrase in the cell (7, 17). These mutants are useful for testing predictions made by a quantita-tive model which ascribes a central role to the structural organization of the carboxysomes in the functioning of the C1-concentrating mechanism and CO2 fixation in cyanobacteria (19). In Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, the lesions in all of the C02-dependent mutants (identified so far) have been mapped in the genomic region of the rbc operon, encoding the large and small subunits of rubisco (4, 8, 18). Friedberg et al. (4) identified two open reading frames (ORFs) in the 5'-flanking region of rbc: ORFI (designated ccmN in reference 18) and ORFII (designated ccmO in this report). Modifica-tions of ccmN (4), ccmK, ccmL, and ccmM (located upstream of ccmN [18]) resulted in mutants requiring high levels of C02, suggesting that some of the genes involved in the ability of this organism to grow under low levels of CO2 are clustered in this region. On the other hand, insertion of nptII (conferring kanamycin resistance [Kmr]) near the C terminus of ccmO, located immediately upstream of rbc, resulted in Kmr mutants capable of growing under high and low CO2 concentrations. It was therefore suggested that this ORF is not involved in},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that are currently being developed as biological production platforms. They derive energy from light and carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide, and some species can fix atmospheric nitrogen. One advantage of developing cyanobacteria for renewable production of biofuels and other biological products is that they are amenable to genetic manipulation, facilitating bioengineering and synthetic biology. To expand the currently available genetic toolkit, we have demonstrated the utility of synthetic theophylline-responsive riboswitches for effective regulation of gene expression in four diverse species of cyanobacteria, including two recent isolates. We evaluated a set of six riboswitches driving expression of a YFP reporter in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Leptolyngbya sp. BL0902, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, and Synechocystis sp. WHSyn. We demonstrated that riboswitches can offer superior regulation of gene expression compared to the commonly used IPTG induction of a lacI(q)-Ptrc promoter system. And we showed that expression of toxic protein SacB can be effectively regulated, demonstrating utility for riboswitch regulation of proteins that are detrimental to biomass accumulation. Taken together, this work demonstrates the utility and ease of use of riboswitches in the context of genetic engineering and synthetic biology in diverse cyanobacteria, which will facilitate development of algal biotechnology.},

The advent of microfluidics opened a new realm of possibilities for inertial focusing in the processing of biological fluids and cellular suspensions and created a field that is now rapidly expanding. Over the past five years, inertial focusing has enabled high-throughput, simple, and precise manipulation of bodily fluids for a myriad of applications in point-of-care and clinical diagnostics. This review describes the theoretical developments that have made the field of inertial focusing what it is today and presents the key applications that will make inertial focusing a mainstream technology in the future.},

ORMOSIL films are prepared from sols containing tetraethoxysilane and isobutyltrimethoxysilane in 2:1 and 1:9 molar ratios. Nile red and a new silanized form of nile red that can be covalently attached to the silicate matrix are used as fluorescent probe molecules. The number and rate of single molecules diffusing through these films increases dramatically with increasing film organic content. Autocorrelation of the fluorescence images yields a quantitative measure of the relative populations of fixed and diffusing species. Surprisingly, both "free" and silicate-bound nile red exhibit relatively facile translational motions. Single-molecule/single-point fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is used to measure the dye diffusion coefficients in submicrometer-scale film regions. The most common diffusion coefficients for "free" and silicate-bound nile red molecules in the 1:9 films are 3.9 x 10(-10) and 1.6 x 10(-10) cm(2)/s, respectively. The unexpectedly rapid diffusion of silicate-bound nile red is attributed to the presence of liquidlike silicate oligomers in the films. A lower bound for the molecular weight of the oligomers is estimated at 2900. Bulk solution-phase FCS experiments performed on "free" and silicate-bound nile red species extracted into chloroform solutions provide valuable support for these conclusions. Comparison of the results derived from experimental and simulated time transients indicates film heterogeneity occurs on sub-100-nm-length scales and likely results from the presence of inorganic- and organic-rich domains.},

We therefore propose that these terms are misleading and should no longer be used. Even without these terms, electrostatic considerations relating to polarized pi systems, as described by Hunter and Sanders, have provided a good qualitative starting place for predicting and understanding the interactions between aromatics for almost two decades. More recent work, however, is revealing that direct electrostatic interactions between polarized atoms of substituents as well as solvation/desolvation effects in strongly interacting solvents must also be considered and even dominate in many circumstances.},

  abstract = {The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a simple, cost effective, high-resolution mass sensing technique, based upon the piezoelectric effect. As a methodology, the QCM evolved a solution measurement capability in largely analytical chemistry and electrochemistry applications due to its sensitive solution-surface interface measurement capability. The technique possesses a wide detection range. At the low mass end, it can detect monolayer surface coverage by small molecules or polymer films. At the upper end, it is capable of detecting much larger masses bound to the surface. These can be complex arrays of biopolymers and biomacromolecules, even whole cells. In addition, the QCM can provide information about the energy dissipating properties of the bound surface mass. Another important and unique feature of the technique is the ability to measure mass and energy dissipation properties of films while simultaneously carrying out electrochemistry on solution species or upon film systems bound to the upper electrode on the oscillating quartz crystal surface. These measurements can describe the course of electropolymerization of a film or can reveal ion or solute transport within a film during changes in the film environment or state, including the oxidation state for an electroactive film driven by the underlying surface potential. The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth in the application of the QCM technique to the study of a wide range of molecular systems at the solution-surface interface, in particular, biopolymer and biochemical systems. In this report, we start with a brief historical and technical overview. Then we discuss the application of the QCM technique to measurements involving micellar systems, self-assembling monolayers and their phase transition behavior, molecularly imprinted polymers, chemical sensors, films formed using the layer-by-layer assembly technique, and biopolymer films and point out the utility of the electrochemical capabilities of the technique to characterizing film properties, especially electroactive polymer films. We also describe the wide range of surface chemistries and attachment strategies used by investigators to bring about surface attachment and multi-layer interactions of these thin film systems. Next we review the wide range of recent applications of the technique to: studies of complex biochemical and biomimetic systems, the creation of protein and nucleic acid biosensors, studies of attached living cells and whole cell biosensor applications. Finally, we discuss future technical directions and applications of the QCM technique to areas such as drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS Sylgard 184, Dow Corning Corporation) pre-polymer was combined with increasing amounts of cross-linker (5.7, 10.0, 14.3, 21.4, and 42.9 wt.\%) and designated PDMS1, PDMS2, PDMS3, PDMS4, and PDMS5, respectively. These materials were processed by spin coating and subjected to common micro-fabrication, micro-machining, and biomedical processes: chemical immersion, oxygen plasma treatment, sterilization, and exposure to tissue culture media. The PDMS formulations were analyzed by gravimetry, goniometry, tensile testing, nano-indentation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Spin coating of PDMS was formulation dependent with film thickness ranging from 308 microm on PDMS1 to 171 microm on PDMS5 at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm). Ultimate tensile stress (UTS) increased from 3.9 MPa (PDMS1) to 10.8 MPa (PDMS3), and then decreased down to 4.0 MPa (PDMS5). Autoclave sterilization (AS) increased the storage modulus (sigma) and UTS in all formulations, with the highest increase in UTS exhibited by PDMS5 (218\%). PDMS surface hydrophilicity and micro-textures were generally unaffected when exposed to the different chemicals, except for micro-texture changes after immersion in potassium hydroxide and buffered hydrofluoric, nitric, sulfuric, and hydrofluoric acids; and minimal changes in contact angle after immersion in hexane, hydrochloric acid, photoresist developer, and toluene. Oxygen plasma treatment decreased the contact angle of PDMS2 from 109 degrees to 60 degrees. Exposure to tissue culture media resulted in increased PDMS surface element concentrations of nitrogen and oxygen.},

The ability to compartmentalize cells within picoliter droplets in microfluidic devices has opened up a wide range of strategies to extract information at the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic level from large numbers of individual cells. Studying the different molecular landscapes at single-cell resolution has provided the authors with a detailed picture of intracellular heterogeneity and the resulting changes in cellular phenotypes. In addition, these technologies have aided in the discovery of rare cells in tumors or in the immune system, and left the authors with a deeper understanding of the fundamental biological processes that determine cell fate. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of the various droplet microfluidic strategies reported in the literature, taking into account the sometimes subtle differences in workflow or reagents that enable or improve certain protocols. Specifically, approaches to targeted- and whole-genome analysis, as well as whole-transcriptome profiling techniques, are reviewed. In addition, an up-to-date overview of new methods to characterize and quantify single-cell protein levels, and of developments to screen secreted molecules such as antibodies, cytokines, or metabolites at the single-cell level, is provided.},

We demonstrate that (i) the ftsZ and zipN genes are essential for the viability of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, whereas the minCDE cluster is dispensable for cell growth; (ii) the GTP-binding domain of FtsZ is crucial to FtsZ assembly into the septal ring at midcell; (iii) the Z-ring of deeply constricted daughter cells is oriented perpendicularly to the mother Z-ring, showing that Synechocystis divides in alternating perpendicular planes; (iv) the MinCDE system affects the morphology of the cell, as well as the position and the shape of FtsZ structures; and (v) MinD is targeted to cell membranes in a process involving its C-terminal amphipathic helix, but not its ATP-binding region. Finally, we have also characterized a novel Z-interacting protein, ZipN, the N-terminal DnaJ domain of which is critical to the decoration of the Z-ring, and we report that this process is independent of MinCDE.},

Compartmentalization of single cells in droplets enables the analysis of proteins released from or secreted by cells, thereby overcoming one of the major limitations of traditional flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. As an example of this approach, we detail a binding assay for detecting antibodies secreted from single mouse hybridoma cells. Secreted antibodies are detected after only 15 min by co-compartmentalizing single mouse hybridoma cells, a fluorescent probe and single beads coated with anti-mouse IgG antibodies in 50-pl droplets. The beads capture the secreted antibodies and, when the captured antibodies bind to the probe, the fluorescence becomes localized on the beads, generating a clearly distinguishable fluorescence signal that enables droplet sorting at ∼200 Hz as well as cell enrichment. The microfluidic system described is easily adapted for screening other intracellular, cell-surface or secreted proteins and for quantifying catalytic or regulatory activities. In order to screen ∼1 million cells, the microfluidic operations require 2-6 h; the entire process, including preparation of microfluidic devices and mammalian cells, requires 5-7 d. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

In vivo, the functional form of FtsZ is the polymeric, ring-like structure (Z-ring) assembled at the future division site during cell division. While it is clear that the Z-ring plays an essential role in orchestrating cytokinesis, precisely what its functions are and how these functions are achieved remain elusive. In this article, we review what we have learned during the past decade about the Z-ring's structure, function, and dynamics, with a particular focus on insights generated by recent high-resolution imaging and single-molecule analyses. We suggest that the major function of the Z-ring is to govern nascent cell pole morphogenesis by directing the spatiotemporal distribution of septal cell wall remodeling enzymes through the Z-ring's GTP hydrolysis-dependent treadmilling dynamics. In this role, FtsZ functions in cell division as the counterpart of the cell shape-determining actin homolog MreB in cell elongation. 309},

Each method is based on the measurement of a physical quantity that is sensible to a change in the surface diffusivity so that experimental data can be used to extract a value of the surface diffusivity. After a brief sketch of the experimental set-up, the present theoretical models proposed to describe the kinetics of the methods by a balance equation or a system of such equations are presented. It is then explained that when a (usually numerical) solution of the model is fitted against experimental data, values of the associated kinetic parameters, especially the surface and pore diffusivities, can be obtained. It is also explained how values of these two diffusivities can be separated from each other, which is often a challenging task. The advantages and disadvantages of the four methods are pointed out in each case, and we eventually provide a comparison between the methods. A discussion of the concentration and temperature dependencies of the surface diffusivity precedes the review of the methods. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Metabolic crossfeeding is an important process that can broadly shape microbial communities. However, little is known about specific crossfeeding principles that drive the formation and maintenance of individuals within a mixed population. Here, we devised a series of synthetic syntrophic communities to probe the complex interactions underlying metabolic exchange of amino acids. We experimentally analyzed multimember, multidimensional communities of Escherichia coli of increasing sophistication to assess the outcomes of synergistic crossfeeding. We find that biosynthetically costly amino acids including methionine, lysine, isoleucine, arginine, and aromatics, tend to promote stronger cooperative interactions than amino acids that are cheaper to produce. Furthermore, cells that share common intermediates along branching pathways yielded more synergistic growth, but exhibited many instances of both positive and negative epistasis when these interactions scaled to higher dimensions. In more complex communities, we find certain members exhibiting keystone species-like behavior that drastically impact the community dynamics. Based on comparative genomic analysis of {$>$}6,000 sequenced bacteria from diverse environments, we present evidence suggesting that amino acid biosynthesis has been broadly optimized to reduce individual metabolic burden in favor of enhanced crossfeeding to support synergistic growth across the biosphere. These results improve our basic understanding of microbial syntrophy while also highlighting the utility and limitations of current modeling approaches to describe the dynamic complexities underlying microbial ecosystems. This work sets the foundation for future endeavors to resolve key questions in microbial ecology and evolution, and presents a platform to develop better and more robust engineered synthetic communities for industrial biotechnology.},

  abstract = {Interest in the human microbiome is at an all time high. The number of human microbiome studies is growing exponentially, as are reported associations between microbial communities and disease. However, we have not been able to translate the ever-growing amount of microbiome sequence data into better health. To do this, we need a practical means of transforming a disease-associated microbiome into a health-associated microbiome. This will require a framework that can be used to generate predictions about community dynamics within the microbiome under different conditions, predictions that can be tested and validated. In this review, using the gut microbiome to illustrate, we describe two classes of model that are currently being used to generate predictions about microbial community dynamics: ecological models and metabolic models. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and discuss the insights into the gut microbiome that have emerged from modeling thus far. We then argue that the two approaches can be combined to yield a community metabolic model, which will supply the framework needed to move from high-throughput omics data to testable predictions about how prebiotic, probiotic, and nutritional interventions affect the microbiome. We are confident that with a suitable model, researchers and clinicians will be able to harness the stream of sequence data and begin designing strategies to make targeted alterations to the microbiome and improve health.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.},

Generally speaking, bioencapsulation allows protecting cells from harsh environment and controlling their surrounding as well as their concentration. This combination produces ultimately a device that can be oriented to drive the desired biochemical reactions. Particularly, this article highlights that functional living matters are very promising in the development of new eco-friendly processes. Compared to conventional chemical process, these hybrid systems would be enabled to use greater and in more efficient way renewable resources (i.e. solar energy) to produce a vast array of chemicals. Additionally, encapsulated cell technology has opened the possibility to design various other kinds of bioactive materials such as cleaning systems, biosensors and artificial organs.

With the view to designing new functional materials, the physiological activity and cellular response of entrapped cells within different silica-based matrices have been assessed. A fine-tuning of the surface chemistry of the matrix has been achieved by the in situ copolymerization of an aqueous silica precursor and a biocompatible trifunctional silane bearing covalently bound neutral sugars. This method allows a facile control of chemical and physical interactions between the entrapped plant cells and the scaffold. The results show that the cell-matrix interaction has to be carefully controlled in order to avoid the mineralization of the cell wall which typically reduces the bioavailability of nutrients. Under appropriate conditions, the introduction of a trifunctional silane (ca. 10\%) during the preparation of hybrid gels has shown to prolong the biological activity as well as the cellular viability of plant cells. The relations of cell behavior with some other key factors such as the porosity and the contraction of the matrix are also discussed.},

There is significant interest in the direct, quantitative assessment of membrane viscosity. Here we report the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of the molecular rotor BODIPY C10 in the membranes of live Escherichia coli bacteria to permit direct quantification of the viscosity. Using this approach, we investigated the viscosity in live E. coli cells, spheroplasts, and liposomes made from E. coli membrane extracts. For live cells and spheroplasts, the viscosity was measured at both room temperature (23°C) and the E. coli growth temperature (37°C), while the membrane extract liposomes were studied over a range of measurement temperatures (5–40°C). At 37°C, we recorded a membrane viscosity in live E. coli cells of 950 cP, which is considerably higher than that previously observed in other live cell membranes (e.g., eukaryotic cells, membranes of Bacillus vegetative cells). Interestingly, this indicates that E. coli cells exhibit a high degree of lipid ordering within their liquid-phase plasma membranes.},

This has inspired fast-growing interest in engineering synthetic microbial consortia for biotechnology development. However, there are relatively few reports of their use in real-world applications, and achieving population stability and regulation has proven to be challenging. In this work, we bridge ecology theory with engineering principles to develop robust synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for efficient biosynthesis of valuable products from lignocellulosic feedstocks. The required biological functions are divided between two specialists: the fungus Trichoderma reesei, which secretes cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass into soluble saccharides, and the bacterium Escherichia coli, which metabolizes soluble saccharides into desired products. We developed and experimentally validated a comprehensive mathematical model for T. reesei/E. coli consortia, providing insights on key determinants of the system's performance. To illustrate the bioprocessing potential of this consortium, we demonstrate direct conversion of microcrystalline cellulose and pretreated corn stover to isobutanol. Without costly nutrient supplementation, we achieved titers up to 1.88 g/L and yields up to 62\% of theoretical maximum. In addition, we show that cooperator-cheater dynamics within T. reesei/E. coli consortia lead to stable population equilibria and provide a mechanism for tuning composition. Although we offer isobutanol production as a proof-of-concept application, our modular system could be readily adapted for production of many other valuable biochemicals.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a new method for creating synthetic tissue that has the potential to capture the three-dimensional (3D) complexity of a multi-cellular organism with submicron precision. Using multiple laminar fluid flows in a microfluidic network, we convey cells to an assembly area where multiple, time-shared optical tweezers are used to organize them into a complex array. The cells are then encapsulated in a 30 microm x 30 microm x 45 microm volume of photopolymerizable hydrogel that mimicks an extra-cellular matrix. To extend the size, shape and constituency of the array without loss of viability, we then step to an adjacent location while maintaining registration with the reference array, and repeat the process. Using this step-and-repeat method, we formed a heterogeneous array of E. coli genetically engineered with a lac switch that is functionally linked to fluorescence reporters. We then induced the array using ligands through a microfluidic network and followed the space-time development of the fluorescence to evaluate viability and metabolic activity.},

Microstructural observation revealed that surface structures that can trap air are important for the preparation of low-sliding-angle surfaces. We have also derived an equation that describes the relationship between sliding angles and contact angles on superhydrophobic surfaces with roughness. The results calculated on the basis of this equation agreed well with the experimental ones. Moreover, we have successfully prepared a transparent superhydrophobic film whose sliding angle is ?1° for a 7 mg water droplet. On this film, there was almost no resistance to the sliding of water droplets. The film obtained satisfies the requirements of superhydrophobicity, transparency, and a low water sliding angle.},

Genes ftsE, ftsI, ftsQ, ftsW, and (previously recognized) ftsZ, minC, minD, minE and sulA were identified as homologues of cell division genes of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Transposon mutagenesis of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 identified five additional genes, cdv1, cdv2, cdv3, ftn6 and cikA, involved in cell division. cdv1 encodes a presumptive periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. cdv2 has similarity to ylmF which, like divIVA, lies within the Gram-positive bacterial ylm gene cluster whose members have functions associated with division. Conservation of other ylm genes in cyanobacteria suggests that cyanobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria share specific division proteins. Two ylm homologues are also found in algal and plant genomes. cdv3 has low but significant similarity to divIVA, suggesting that minE and cdv3 both mediate division-site determination in cyanobacteria. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria lack minE, and (Gram-negative) proteobacteria lack divIVA. ftn6, of unknown function, and the circadian input kinase, cikA, are specific to cyanobacteria. In S. elongatus, unlike in other bacteria, FtsZ rings are formed at sites occupied by nucleoids. Thus, the division machinery of cyanobacteria differs in its composition and regulation from that of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.},

Because of its reliability, userfriendliness and support of many species ClueGO gained a large community of users. To further allow scientists programmatic access to ClueGO with R, Python, JavaScript etc., we implemented the cyREST API into ClueGO. In this article we describe this novel, complementary way of accessing ClueGO via REST, and provide R and Phyton examples to demonstrate how ClueGO workflows can be integrated into bioinformatic analysis pipelines.

  abstract = {Directed embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation is a potentially powerful approach for generating a renewable source of cells for regenerative medicine. Typical in vitro ES cell differentiation protocols involve the formation of ES cell aggregate intermediates called embryoid bodies (EBs). Recently, we demonstrated the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) microwells as templates for directing the formation of these aggregates, offering control over parameters such as size, shape, and homogeneity. Despite these promising results, the previously developed technology was limited as it was difficult to reproducibly obtain cultures of homogeneous EBs with high efficiency and retrievability. In this study, we improve the platform by optimizing a number of features: material composition of the microwells, cell seeding procedures, and aggregate retrieval methods. Adopting these modifications, we demonstrate an improved degree of homogeneity of the resulting aggregate populations and establish a robust protocol for eliciting high EB formation efficiencies. The optimized microwell array system is a potentially versatile tool for ES cell differentiation studies and high-throughput stem cell experimentation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Specifically, we engineered an inducible system that can bind and segregate plasmid DNA to a single position in the cell. Upon cell division, colocalized plasmids are kept by one and only one of the daughter cells. The other daughter cell receives no plasmid DNA and is irreversibly differentiated from its sibling. In this way, we achieved asymmetric cell division through asymmetric plasmid partitioning. We then used this system to achieve physical separation of genetically distinct cells by tying motility to differentiation. Finally, we characterized an orthogonal inducible circuit that enables the simultaneous asymmetric partitioning of two plasmid species, resulting in cells that have four distinct differentiated states. These results point the way toward the engineering of multicellular systems from prokaryotic hosts.},

The method is illustrated with the transport of warfarin [1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-coumarinyl)-1-phenyl-3-butanone].

  abstract = {Heterotypic cooperation—two populations exchanging distinct benefits that are costly to produce—is widespread. Cheaters, exploiting benefits while evading contribution, can undermine cooperation. Two mechanisms can stabilize heterotypic cooperation. In ‘partner choice’, cooperators recognize and choose cooperating over cheating partners; in ‘partner fidelity feedback’, fitness-feedback from repeated interactions ensures that aiding your partner helps yourself. How might a spatial environment, which facilitates repeated interactions, promote fitness-feedback? We examined this process through mathematical models and engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains incapable of recognition. Here, cooperators and their heterotypic cooperative partners (partners) exchanged distinct essential metabolites. Cheaters exploited partner-produced metabolites without reciprocating, and were competitively superior to cooperators. Despite initially random spatial distributions, cooperators gained more partner neighbors than cheaters did. The less a cheater contributed, the more it was excluded and disfavored. This self-organization, driven by asymmetric fitness effects of cooperators and cheaters on partners during cell growth into open space, achieves assortment.Cooperation between individuals of the same species, and also between different species, is known to be important in evolution. Large fish, for example, rely on small cleaner fish to remove parasites, while the small fish benefit from the nutrients in these parasites. However, cooperation can be undermined by other individuals or species who “cheat” by taking advantage of those who cooperate, without providing any benefits in return. For example, some cleaner fish cheat by biting off healthy tissue from their host, in addition to parasites.Genetically-related individuals who cooperate by sharing identical benefits can combat cheaters by giving preferential treatment to their relatives (a process known as kin discrimination) or by staying close to the relatives to form clusters (kin fidelity). However, two genetically-unrelated populations that mutually cooperate by sharing different benefits cannot employ these methods to overcome cheaters. Instead they rely on either partner choice or partner fidelity feedback.Partner choice – the approach adopted by cleaner fish and their hosts – relies on one population recognizing a signal from the other population and responding accordingly: for example, large fish observe cleaner fish and approach those that cooperate with their current host and avoid those that cheat. Partner fidelity feedback, on the other hand, relies on repeated interactions between the two populations providing an advantage in terms of evolutionary fitness to both: for example, organelles called mitochondria and chloroplasts live inside cells, helping the cells to harvest energy and providing energy for themselves and the host cells in the process. In some cases – such as the cooperation between figs and fig wasps, or between certain plants and the bacteria that fix nitrogen in their roots – researchers cannot agree if the populations are relying on partner choice or partner fidelity feedback.Now Momeni et al. have used a combination of experiments on yeast and mathematical modeling to explore partner fidelity feedback in greater detail. They started by using genetic engineering techniques to produce two species of yeast that mutually cooperate, each providing a metabolite that is essential to the other, but are not able to recognize each other: this means that these populations cannot rely on partner choice to combat cheaters. Momeni et al. then observed how these two species interacted with each other and a third species of yeast that cheated by consuming one of the metabolites without releasing any metabolite of its own.Momeni et al. found that as long as there was space for the yeast cells to grow into, the two species that cooperated self-organized into mixed clusters, with the cheating species being excluded from these clusters. The self-organization was driven by a positive feedback loop involving the two species that cooperated, with each species helping to increase the fitness of the other. The results of Momeni et al. demonstrate that it is possible for two genetically unrelated populations to cooperate and combat cheaters without the use of partner choice.},

The GEMs enable a systems approach to characterizing the pan and core metabolic capabilities of the E. coli species. The majority of pan metabolic content was found to consist of alternate catabolic pathways for unique nutrient sources. The GEMs were then used to systematically analyze growth capabilities in more than 650 different growth-supporting environments. The results show that unique strain-specific metabolic capabilities correspond to pathotypes and environmental niches. Twelve of the GEMs were used to predict growth on six differentiating nutrients, and the predictions were found to agree with 80\% of experimental outcomes. Additionally, GEMs were used to predict strain-specific auxotrophies. Twelve of the strains modeled were predicted to be auxotrophic for vitamins niacin (vitamin B3), thiamin (vitamin B1), or folate (vitamin B9). Six of the strains modeled have lost biosynthetic pathways for essential amino acids methionine, tryptophan, or leucine. Genome-scale analysis of multiple strains of a species can thus be used to define the metabolic essence of a microbial species and delineate growth differences that shed light on the adaptation process to a particular microenvironment.},

Metabolic physiology and gene expression varied widely with downstream implications for productivity, product yield, and titer. These differences could be linked to differential regulatory structure. Analyzing high-flux reactions and expression of encoding genes resulted in a correlated and quantitative link between these sets, with strain-specific caveats. Integrated modeling revealed that certain strains are better suited to produce given compounds or express desired constructs considering native expression states of pathways that enable high-production phenotypes.

Organic hydrogels are composed of an organic network cross-linked via chemical or physical reticulation nodes. In contrast, hybrid hydrogels are defined by the coexistence of organic and inorganic moieties in water. Inorganic polymerization, i.e. sol-gel process, is one of the main techniques leading to hybrid hydrogels. The chemoselectivity of this method proceeds through hydrolysis and condensation reactions of metal oxide moieties. In addition, the mild reaction conditions make this process very promising for the preparation of water-containing materials and their bio-applications.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms regulate their responses to many diverse stimuli in an effort to balance light harvesting with utilizable light energy for carbon fixation and growth (source–sink regulation). This balance is critical to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species that can lead to cell death. However, investigating the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria using ensemble-based measurements remains a challenge due to population heterogeneity. Here, to address this problem, we used long-term quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modelling and genetic manipulation to visualize and analyse the growth and subcellular dynamics of individual wild-type and mutant cyanobacterial cells over multiple generations. We reveal that mechanical confinement of actively growing Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 cells leads to the physical disassociation of phycobilisomes and energetic decoupling from the photosynthetic reaction centres. We suggest that the mechanical regulation of photosynthesis is a critical failsafe that prevents cell expansion when light and nutrients are plentiful, but when space is limiting. These results imply that cyanobacteria must convert a fraction of the available light energy into mechanical energy to overcome frictional forces in the environment, providing insight into the regulation of photosynthesis and how microorganisms navigate their physical environment.},

These protofilaments assemble further to form a "Z ring" at the center of prokaryotic cells. The Z ring generates a constriction force on the inner membrane and also serves as a scaffold to recruit cell wall remodeling proteins for complete cell division in vivo. One model of the Z ring proposes that protofilaments associate via lateral bonds to form ribbons; however, lateral bonds are still only hypothetical. To explore potential lateral bonding sites, we probed the surface of Escherichia coli FtsZ by inserting either small peptides or whole fluorescent proteins (FPs). Among the four lateral surfaces on FtsZ protofilaments, we obtained inserts on the front and back surfaces that were functional for cell division. We concluded that these faces are not sites of essential interactions. Inserts at two sites, G124 and R174, located on the left and right surfaces, completely blocked function, and these sites were identified as possible sites for essential lateral interactions. However, the insert at R174 did not interfere with association of protofilaments into sheets and bundles in vitro. Another goal was to find a location within FtsZ that supported insertion of FP reporter proteins while allowing the FtsZ-FPs to function as the sole source of FtsZ. We discovered one internal site, G55-Q56, where several different FPs could be inserted without impairing function. These FtsZ-FPs may provide advances for imaging Z-ring structure by superresolution techniques.},

We found that populations dividing at rates as rapid as once per 10 h manifest circadian gating of cell division, since phases in which cell division slows or stops recur with a circadian periodicity. The data clearly show that Synechococcus cells growing with doubling times that are considerably faster than once per 24 h nonetheless express robust circadian rhythms of cell division and gene expression. Apparently Synechococcus cells are able to simultaneously sustain two timing circuits that express significantly different periods.},

However, the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria prevents CFDA from permeating into the cell. Although EDTA can increase the permeability of the outer membrane allowing CFDA to enter the cells, it was experimentally confirmed that there is still considerable difficulty in visualizing viable cells due to passive diffusion of carboxyfluorescein (CF), a hydrolyzed product of CFDA, out of the cells. We found that glutaraldehyde enhances the discriminative recognition of esterase-active Gram-negative bacteria under microscopic observation by improving the efficacy of staining. We believe the successful staining in the presence of glutaraldehyde is due to two separate effects: an increase in the permeability of CFDA into the cell and prevention of leakage of CF out of the cell.},

However, relevant regulatory details of the NblS-RpaB signalling pathway remain to be elucidated. We recently showed that the response regulator RpaB is regulated by specific (de)phosphorylation from the histidine kinase NblS and that RpaB and its phosphorylatable residue Asp56 are both required for viability of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We show here that the phosphorylated form of RpaB is present in cells growing under standard laboratory conditions and that high light stress affected the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated RpaB. It also decreased the amount of rpaB transcripts without appreciably changing the total levels of RpaB. Quantitative Western blotting and confocal microscopy analyses were consistent with RpaB being a very abundant regulator, with nucleoid localization. A genetically engineered RpaB-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein rescued lethality of the rpaB null mutant, indicating that it was functional. This is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating in a cyanobacterium, and for a two-component response regulator, that the in vivo ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated protein changes in response to environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Encapsulated cell bioaugmentation is a novel alternative solution to in situ bioremediation of contaminated aquifers. This study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of such a remediation strategy based on the performance of encapsulated cells in the biodegradation of gasoline, a major groundwater contaminant. An enriched bacterial consortium, isolated from a gasoline-polluted site, was encapsulated in gellan gum microbeads (16-53 microm diameter). The capacity of the encapsulated cells to degrade gasoline under aerobic conditions was evaluated in comparison with free (non-encapsulated) cells. Encapsulated cells (2.6 mg(cells) x g(-1) bead) degraded over 90\% gasoline hydrocarbons (initial concentration 50-600 mg x L(-1)) within 5-10 days at 10 degrees C. Equivalent levels of free cells removed comparable amounts of gasoline (initial concentration 50-400 mg x L(-1)) within the same period but required up to 30 days to degrade the highest level of gasoline tested (600 mg x L(-1)). Free cells exhibited a lag phase in biodegradation, which increased from 1 to 5 days with an increase in gasoline concentration (200-600 x mg L(-1)). Encapsulation provided cells with a protective barrier against toxic hydrocarbons, eliminating the adaptation period required by free cells. The reduction of encapsulated cell mass loading from 2.6 to 1.0 mg(cells) x g(-1) bead caused a substantial decrease in the extent of biodegradation within a 30-day incubation period. Encapsulated cells dispersed within the porous soil matrix of saturated soil microcosms demonstrated a reduced performance in the removal of gasoline (initial concentrations of 400 and 600 mg x L(-1)), removing 30-50\% gasoline hydrocarbons compared to 40-60\% by free cells within 21 days of incubation. The results of this study suggest that gellan gum-encapsulated bacterial cells have the potential to be used for biodegradation of gasoline hydrocarbons in aqueous systems.},

Here we describe the construction (lamellar organization) of these spicules and of the comitalia and highlight their organic matrix in order to understand their mechanical properties. The spicules display three distinct regions built of biosilica: (i) the outer lamellar zone (radius: {$>$}300 μm), (ii) the bulky axial cylinder (radius: {$<$}75 μm), and (iii) the central axial canal (diameter: {$<$}2 μm) with its organic axial filament. The spicules are loosely covered with a collagen net which is regularly perforated by 7-10 μm large holes; the net can be silicified. The silica layers forming the lamellar zone are ≈5 μm thick; the central axial cylinder appears to be composed of almost solid silica which becomes porous after etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF). Dissolution of a complete spicule discloses its complex structure with distinct lamellae in the outer zone (lamellar coating) and a more resistant central part (axial barrel). Rapidly after the release of the organic coating from the lamellar zone the protein layers disintegrate to form irregular clumps/aggregates. In contrast, the proteinaceous axial barrel, hidden in the siliceous axial cylinder, is set up by rope-like filaments. Biochemical analysis revealed that the (dominant) molecule of the lamellar coating is a 27-kDa protein which displays catalytic, proteolytic activity. High resolution electron microscopic analysis showed that this protein is arranged within the lamellae and stabilizes these surfaces by palisade-like pillars. The mechanical behavior of the spicules was analyzed by a 3-point bending assay, coupled with scanning electron microscopy. The load-extension curve of the spicule shows a biphasic breakage/cracking pattern. The outer lamellar zone cracks in several distinct steps showing high resistance in concert with comparably low elasticity, while the axial cylinder breaks with high elasticity and lower stiffness. The complex bioorganic/inorganic hybrid composition and structure of the Monorhaphis spicules might provide the blueprint for the synthesis of bio-inspired material, with unusual mechanical properties (strength, stiffness) without losing the exceptional properties of optical transmission. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Until now only the sol-gel precursor technology was utilized to immobilize bacteria or yeast cells in silica. With the discovery of silicatein, an enzyme from demosponges that catalyzes the formation of poly(silicate), it became possible to synthesize poly(silicate) under physiological (ambient) conditions. Here we show that Escherichia coli can be transformed with the silicatein gene, its expression level in the presence of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) can be efficiently intensified by co-incubation with silicic acid. This effect could be demonstrated on the level of recombinant protein synthesis as well as by immunostaining analysis. The heterologously produced silicatein is enzymatically active, as confirmed by staining with Rhodamine 123 (formation for poly[silicate] from silicic acid) and by reacting free silicic acid with the β-silicomolybdato color system. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that the bacteria that express silicatein form a viscous cover around them when growing in the presence of silicic acid. Finally, we demonstrate that the growth kinetics of E. coli remains unaffected whether or not the bacteria had been transformed with silicatein or grown in medium, supplemented with silicic acid. It is concluded that silicatein-mediated encapsulation of bacteria with silica might improve, extend and optimize the range of application of bacteria for the production of recombinant protein. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This review includes environmental applications of these biosurfactants for soil and water treatment. Biosurfactant applications in the environmental industries are promising due to their biodegradability, low toxicity and effectiveness in enhancing biodegradation and solubilization of low solubility compounds. However, more information is needed to be able to predict and model their behaviour. Full scale tests will be required. The role of biosurfactants in natural attenuation processes has not been determined. Very little information is available concerning the influence of soil components on the remediation process with biosurfactants.

TPPBs are constructed by adding a non-aqueous phase (e.g. hexadecane, silicone oil) to an aqueous phase that contains the microorganisms responsible for degrading the VOCs. Presence of a water-immiscible phase improves the transfer of hydrophobic substrates (e.g. hexane, oxygen) or reduces the toxicity of inhibitory substances (e.g. benzene, toluene) to the microorganisms present in the aqueous phase. The non-aqueous phase is selected based on cost, safety, good partitioning properties towards the target pollutants, biocompatibility, and non-biodegradability. TPPBs have hitherto been designed as laboratory-scale well-mixed stirred-tank reactors or as biofilters that contain a non-aqueous phase. Scale-up and industrial use of TPPBs require elucidation and modeling of the mechanisms of substrate transfer and uptake; understanding of the mechanisms of microbial selection; identification or synthesis of new inexpensive and robust non-aqueous phases; and generation of suitable guidelines for process design and control. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {We have engineered the cell surface of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by anchoring active glucoamylase protein on the cell wall, and we have endowed the yeast cells with the ability to utilize starch directly as the sole carbon source. The gene encoding Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase with its secretion signal peptide was fused with the gene encoding the C-terminal half (320 amino acid residues from the C terminus) of yeast alpha-agglutinin, a protein involved in mating and covalently anchored to the cell wall. The constructed plasmid containing this fusion gene was introduced into S. cerevisiae and expressed under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter from S. cerevisiae. The glucoamylase activity as not detected in the culture medium, but it was detected in the cell pellet fraction. The glucoamylase protein transferred to the soluble fraction from the cell wall fraction after glucanase treatment but not after sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment, indicating the covalent binding of the fusion protein to the cell wall. Display of the fused protein was further confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy. The transformant cells could surely grow on starch as the sole carbon source. These results showed that the glucoamylase was anchored on the cell wall and displayed as its active form. This is the first example of an application of cell surface engineering to utilize and improve the metabolic ability of cells.},

Methods are lacking for researchers to affordably coordinate the quantification and analysis of part performance across varied environments, as needed to identify, evaluate and improve problematic part types. We developed an easy-to-use analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework for quantifying the performance of genetic elements. For proof of concept, we assembled and analyzed combinations of prokaryotic transcription and translation initiation elements in Escherichia coli. We determined how estimation of part activity relates to the number of unique element combinations tested, and we show how to estimate expected ensemble-wide part activity from just one or two measurements. We propose a new statistic, biomolecular part 'quality', for tracking quantitative variation in part performance across changing contexts.},

In this Review, we discuss how the spatial arrangement of genotypes within a community influences the cooperative and competitive cell-cell interactions that define biofilm form and function.

It is are also a potential cell factory for the production of renewable biofuels and valuable chemicals. We employed engineered riboswitches to control translational initiation of target genes in this cyanobacterium. A firefly luciferase reporter assay revealed that three theophylline riboswitches performed as expected in the cyanobacterium. Riboswitch-E* exhibited very low leaky expression of luciferase and superior and dose-dependent on/off regulation of protein expression by theophylline. The maximum magnitude of the induction vs. basal level was ∼190-fold. Furthermore, the induction level was responsive to a wide range of theophylline concentrations in the medium, from 0 to 2 mM, facilitating the fine-tuning of luciferase expression. We adapted this riboswitch to another gene regulation system, in which expression of the circadian clock kaiC gene product is controlled by the theophylline concentration in the culture medium. The results demonstrated that the adequately adjusted expression level of KaiC restored complete circadian rhythm in the kaiC-deficient arrhythmic mutant. This theophylline-dependent riboswitch system has potential for various applications as a useful genetic tool in cyanobacteria.},

This principle of macroporous morphology control can be best applied to pure silica and silica-based multicomponent oxide systems. The earlier the phase separation takes place than the sol-gel transition, the larger the characteristic sizes of pores and gel skeletons become. The time resolved light scattering measurements revealed that the morphology formation process exhibits the features of spinodal decomposition and that the final gel morphology is determined by the competitive kinetics between the domain coarsening and the structure freezing by sol-gel transition. The mesopore structure of such macroporous gel skeletons could be easily tailored by the solvent exchange procedures. Silica gels with controlled macropores and mesopores were successfully applied as a material for the continuous rod type column for high performance liquid chromatography.},

GAC was loaded with phenol, via batch adsorption tests, then electrochemically regenerated and finally reloaded with phenol. Regeneration was conducted in a batch reactor filled with a 1 \% NaCl solution as the electrolyte. As limited experiments showed that cathodic regeneration was 5-10\% more efficient than anodic regeneration, the investigation concentrated on the former. Although anodic regeneration was more efficient in destroying phenol residuals from the electrolyte, cathodic regeneration could also eliminate these residuals by using longer regeneration times and/or higher currents. Increasing the regeneration current to 100 mA for 5 hours can increase the regeneration efficiency (RE) to a maximum of 95\%. Lower currents applied for longer regeneration times can yield similar results. REs were also significantly affected by the electrolyte type, the electrolyte concentration, and the GAC particle size, but not by the phenol loadings. Multiple regenerations only reduce the REs an additional 2\% per cycle. Given the high regeneration efficiencies and no apparent carbon losses, electrochemical regeneration of GAC at a laboratory-scale is a feasible alternative to thermal regeneration and merits further investigation. ?? 1994.},

Yeast spores and bacteria have also been recently immobilized within silica gels where they retain their enzymatic activity, but the problem of the long-term viability of whole cells in an inorganic matrix has never been fully addressed. It is a real challenge for the development of sol-gel processes. Generic tests have been performed to check the viability of Escherichia coli bacteria in silica gels. Surprisingly, more bacteria remain culturable in the gel than in an aqueous suspension. The metabolic activity of the bacteria towards glycolysis decreases slowly, but half of the bacteria are still viable after one month. When confined within a mineral environment, bacteria do not form colonies. The exchange of chemical signals between isolated bacteria rather than aggregates can then be studied, a point that could be very important for 'quorum sensing'.},

Whole cells remain viable and retain their metabolic activity leading to the formation of living biohybrids that offer new possibilities in the field of biotechnology and nanomedicine. Diatom frustules exhibit an incredible variety of sophisticated shapes; they can be used as 3D hierarchically structured materials for the realization of sensors, photonic devices or microfluidics. They can also be a model for the bio-templated synthesis of nanostructured materials.

Moreover, at the end of this period, nearly 100\% of the initial cell population remain viable within the gels.

  abstract = {The cell wall envelope of gram-positive bacteria is a macromolecular, exoskeletal organelle that is assembled and turned over at designated sites. The cell wall also functions as a surface organelle that allows gram-positive pathogens to interact with their environment, in particular the tissues of the infected host. All of these functions require that surface proteins and enzymes be properly targeted to the cell wall envelope. Two basic mechanisms, cell wall sorting and targeting, have been identified. Cell well sorting is the covalent attachment of surface proteins to the peptidoglycan via a C-terminal sorting signal that contains a consensus LPXTG sequence. More than 100 proteins that possess cell wall-sorting signals, including the M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A of Staphylococcus aureus, and several internalins of Listeria monocytogenes, have been identified. Cell wall targeting involves the noncovalent attachment of proteins to the cell surface via specialized binding domains. Several of these wall-binding domains appear to interact with secondary wall polymers that are associated with the peptidoglycan, for example teichoic acids and polysaccharides. Proteins that are targeted to the cell surface include muralytic enzymes such as autolysins, lysostaphin, and phage lytic enzymes. Other examples for targeted proteins are the surface S-layer proteins of bacilli and clostridia, as well as virulence factors required for the pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes (internalin B) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PspA) infections. In this review we describe the mechanisms for both sorting and targeting of proteins to the envelope of gram-positive bacteria and review the functions of known surface proteins.},

Using poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate hydrogels with varying polymer chain length and photolithographic patterning techniques, we are able to provide substrates with spatially patterned, tunable mechanical properties in both gradients and distinct patterns. The hydrogels can be patterned to produce anisotropic structures and exhibit patterned strain under mechanical loading.

  abstract = {Fluorescence-based assays for the cytochrome P450 BM3 monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium address an attractive biotechnological challenge by facilitating enzyme engineering and the identification of potential substrates of this highly promising biocatalyst. In the current study, we used the scarcity of corresponding screening systems as an opportunity to evaluate a novel and continuous high-throughput assay for this unique enzyme. A set of nine catalytically diverse P450 BM3 variants was constructed and tested toward the native substrate-inspired fluorogenic substrate 12-(4-trifluoromethylcoumarin-7- yloxy)dodecanoic acid. Particularly high enzyme-mediated O-dealkylation yielding the fluorescent product 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin was observed with mutants containing the F87V substitution, with A74G/F87V showing the highest catalytic efficiency (0.458 min-1 μM-1). To simplify the assay procedure and show its versatility, different modes of application were successfully demonstrated, including (i) the direct use of NADPH or its oxidized form NADP+ along with diverse NADPH recycling systems for electron supply, (ii) the use of cell-free lysates and whole-cell preparations as the biocatalyst source, and (iii) its use for competitive inhibition screens to identify or characterize substrates and inhibitors. A detailed comparison with known, fluorescence-based P450 BM3 assays finally emphasizes the relevance of our contribution to the ongoing research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we review the mechanisms involved in quorum sensing with a focus on the Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio cholerae quorum-sensing systems. We discuss the differences between these two quorum-sensing systems and the differences between them and other paradigmatic bacterial signal transduction systems. We argue that the Vibrio quorum-sensing systems are optimally designed to precisely translate extracellular autoinducer information into internal changes in gene expression. We describe how studies of the V. harveyi and V. cholerae quorum-sensing systems have revealed some of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the evolution of collective behaviors.},

In the last decades, the efforts attended to enhance the usage of microalgae and cyanobacteria by genetic manipulation, synthetic and metabolic engineering. However, the development of photoautotrophic cell factories have rarely compared to the heterotrophic counterparts due to limited tools, bioinformatics, and multi-omics database. Therefore, recent advances of their genome editing techniques by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology, and potential applications of their metabolic engineering and regulation approaches are examined in this review. Moreover, the contemporary achievements of synthetic biology approaches of microalgae and cyanobacteria in carbon fixation and sequestration, lipid and triacylglycerol (TAG), and sustainable production of high value-added chemicals, such as carotenoids and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been also discussed. From recent genomic study to trends in metabolic regulation of microalgae and cyanobacteria and a comprehensive assessment of the current challenges and opportunities for microalgae and cyanobacteria is also conducted.},

  abstract = {Sorption isotherms for five aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained with a natural wood char (NC1) and its residue after solvent extraction (ENC1). Substantial isotherm nonlinearity was observed in all cases. ENC1 showed higher BET surface area, higher nitrogen-accessible micropore volume, and lower mass of extractable organic chemicals, including quantifiable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),while the two chars showed identical surface oxygen/ carbon (O/C) ratio. For two chlorinated benzenes that normally condense as liquids at the temperatures used, sorption isotherms with NC1 and ENC1 were found to be statistically identical. For the solid-phase compounds (1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) and two PAHs), sorption was statistically higher with ENC1, thus demonstrating sorption effects due to both (1) authigenic organic content in the sorbentand (2)the sorbate's condensed state. Polanyi-based isotherm modeling, pore size measurements, and comparisons with activated carbon showthe relative importance of adsorptive pore filling and help explain results. With both chars, maximum sorption increased in the order of decreasing molecular diameter: phenanthrene {$<$} naphthalene {$<$} 1,2-dichlorobenzene/1,2,4-trichlorobenzene {$<$} 1,4-DCB. Comparison of 1,4- and 1,2-DCB shows that the critical molecular diameter was apparently more important than the condensed state, suggesting that 1,4-DCB sorbed in the liquid state for ENC1.},

The tri-isocyanate provides an extended degree of branching or reinforcement, resulting in increased compressive strength of the aerogel monoliths while the overall flexibility arising from the underlying silica structure is maintained. The compressive moduli of the reinforced aerogel monoliths in this study range from 0.001 to 158 MPa. Interestingly, formulations across this entire range of modulus recover nearly all of their length after two compressions to 25\% strain.

  abstract = {In 1972 the Fluid - Mosaic Membrane Model of membrane structure was proposed based on thermodynamic principals of organization of membrane lipids and proteins and available evidence of asymmetry and lateral mobility within the membrane matrix [S. J. Singer and G. L. Nicolson, Science 175 (1972) 720-731]. After over 40 years, this basic model of the cell membrane remains relevant for describing the basic nano-structures of a variety of intracellular and cellular membranes of plant and animal cells and lower forms of life. In the intervening years, however, new information has documented the importance and roles of specialized membrane domains, such as lipid rafts and protein/glycoprotein complexes, in describing the macrostructure, dynamics and functions of cellular membranes as well as the roles of membrane-associated cytoskeletal fences and extracellular matrix structures in limiting the lateral diffusion and range of motion of membrane components. These newer data build on the foundation of the original model and add new layers of complexity and hierarchy, but the concepts described in the original model are still applicable today. In updated versions of the model more emphasis has been placed on the mosaic nature of the macrostructure of cellular membranes where many protein and lipid components are limited in their rotational and lateral motilities in the membrane plane, especially in their natural states where lipid-lipid, protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions as well as cell-matrix, cell-cell and intracellular membrane-associated protein and cytoskeletal interactions are important in restraining the lateral motility and range of motion of particular membrane components. The formation of specialized membrane domains and the presence of tightly packed integral membrane protein complexes due to membrane-associated fences, fenceposts and other structures are considered very important in describing membrane dynamics and architecture. These structures along with membrane-associated cytoskeletal and extracellular structures maintain the long-range, non-random mosaic macro-organization of membranes, while smaller membrane nano- and submicro-sized domains, such as lipid rafts and protein complexes, are important in maintaining specialized membrane structures that are in cooperative dynamic flux in a crowded membrane plane.

Past water use was estimated from well-completion data, and future water use was extrapolated from past water use constrained by shale-gas resources. Cumulative water use in the Barnett totaled 145 Mm(3) (2000-mid-2011). Annual water use represents \textasciitilde 9\% of water use in Dallas (population 1.3 million). Water use in younger (2008-mid-2011) plays, although less (6.5 Mm(3) Texas-Haynesville, 18 Mm(3) Eagle Ford), is increasing rapidly. Water use for shale gas is {$<$}1\% of statewide water withdrawals; however, local impacts vary with water availability and competing demands. Projections of cumulative net water use during the next 50 years in all shale plays total \textasciitilde 4350 Mm(3), peaking at 145 Mm(3) in the mid-2020s and decreasing to 23 Mm(3) in 2060. Current freshwater use may shift to brackish water to reduce competition with other users.},

To address whether cyanobacteria could be engineered to produce and secrete organic primary metabolites, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 was engineered to express genes encoding an invertase and a glucose facilitator, which mediated secretion of glucose and fructose. Similarly, expression of lactate dehydrogenase- and lactate transporter-encoding genes allowed lactate accumulation in the extracellular medium. Expression of the relevant transporter was essential for secretion. Production of these molecules was further improved by expression of additional heterologous enzymes. Sugars secreted by the engineered cyanobacteria could be used to support Escherichia coli growth in the absence of additional nutrient sources. These results indicate that cyanobacteria can be engineered to produce and secrete high-value hydrophilic products.},

Some strains of originally antibiotic-susceptible species may also acquire resistance through decreases in the permeability of membrane barriers. Another mechanism for preventing access of drugs to targets is the membrane-associated energy-driven efflux, which plays a major role in drug resistance, especially in combination with the permeation barrier. Recent results indicate the existence of bacterial efflux systems of extremely broad substrate specificity, in many ways reminiscent of the multidrug resistance pump of mammalian cells. One such system seems to play a major role in the intrinsic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common opportunistic pathogen. As the pharmaceutical industry succeeds in producing agents that can overcome specific mechanisms of bacterial resistance, less specific resistance mechanisms such as permeability barriers and multidrug active efflux may become increasingly significant in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria characteristically are surrounded by an additional membrane layer, the outer membrane. Although outer membrane components often play important roles in the interaction of symbiotic or pathogenic bacteria with their host organisms, the major role of this membrane must usually be to serve as a permeability barrier to prevent the entry of noxious compounds and at the same time to allow the influx of nutrient molecules. This review summarizes the development in the field since our previous review (H. Nikaido and M. Vaara, Microbiol. Rev. 49:1-32, 1985) was published. With the discovery of protein channels, structural knowledge enables us to understand in molecular detail how porins, specific channels, TonB-linked receptors, and other proteins function. We are now beginning to see how the export of large proteins occurs across the outer membrane. With our knowledge of the lipopolysaccharide-phospholipid asymmetric bilayer of the outer membrane, we are finally beginning to understand how this bilayer can retard the entry of lipophilic compounds, owing to our increasing knowledge about the chemistry of lipopolysaccharide from diverse organisms and the way in which lipopolysaccharide structure is modified by environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria characteristically are surrounded by an outer membrane (OM). Analysis of prokaryote phylogeny using signature sequences in proteins even led to the notion that a major phylogenetic division exists between organisms with double-membrane envelopes (diderms) and those with only a simple cytoplasmic membrane (monoderms) (240). It is likely that the most important function for the additional membrane layer, the OM, in gram-negative bacteria is to serve as a selective permeation barrier. My earlier review of this subject, written with Martti Vaara, appeared in 1985 (464). It was an opportune time for such a review because the fundamental properties of the Escherichia coli porins and the specific maltodextrin channel, LamB, were characterized a few years earlier (see, for example, references 388 and 460-462) and the asymmetric structure of the OM bilayer, with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) located exclusively in the outer leaflet (316), offered an explanation for the unusually slow influx of lipophilic solutes. In the intervening 18 years, explosive progress has occurred in the field. Diffusion through the nonspecific porin channels and the specific channels are now understood in molecular detail, thanks to the elucidation of the crystal structure of these proteins. Channel proteins were identified in many nonenteric bacteria as a result of the rapid growth of our knowledge of the genome sequences, and in some cases this has offered insights into the physiology of various organisms in their native habitat. Studies of LPS not only showed us the impressive diversity of LPS structures in the bacterial kingdom but also led to the realization that the LPS structure may be modified in response to the conditions prevailing in the environment. The present review attempts to summarize the development in the field since 1985. The major problem in presenting the results has been the information explosion. For example, more than 650 articles with the word "porin" in the title have been published during this period. If the databases are searched with "porin" or "lipopolysaccharide" as keywords, literally thousands of references are retrieved. Therefore, I had to be severely restrictive with citations in order to keep the review within a reasonable (and perhaps useful) size. I tried to limit the discussion strictly to selective permeability, eliminating most papers dealing with the biosynthesis and assembly of the OM or with the role of the OM in the interaction of bacteria with the environment, including higher animals and plants. I also apologize at the outset for the omission of many references which were not cited because the main message could be found in other articles or reviews or, probably most frequently, because of my oversight.},

However, the thermolysis of host cells leads to the heat-induced leakage of thermophilic enzymes, which are produced as soluble proteins, limiting the exploitation of their excellent stability in repeated and continuous reactions. In this study, Escherichia coli cells having the thermophilic fumarase from Thermus thermophilus (TtFTA) were treated with glutaraldehyde to prevent the heat-induced leakage of the enzyme, and the resulting cells were used as a whole-cell catalyst in repeated and continuous reactions. Interestingly, although electron microscopic observations revealed that the cellular structure of glutaraldehyde-treated E. coli was not apparently changed by the heat treatment, the membrane permeability of the heated cells to relatively small molecules (up to at least 3 kDa) was significantly improved. By applying the glutaraldehyde-treated E. coli having TtFTA to a continuous reactor equipped with a cell-separation membrane filter, the enzymatic hydration of fumarate to malate could be operated for more than 600 min with a molar conversion yield of 60\% or higher.},

Conventional grafting-to strategies for conjugating preformed polymers to cell surfaces are limited by low polymer grafting efficiency. Here we report an alternative grafting-from strategy for directly engineering the surfaces of live yeast and mammalian cells through cell surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization. By developing cytocompatible PET-RAFT (photoinduced electron transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization), synthetic polymers with narrow polydispersity (M w /M n {$<$} 1.3) could be obtained at room temperature in 5 minutes. This polymerization strategy enables chain growth to be initiated directly from chain-transfer agents anchored on the surface of live cells using either covalent attachment or non-covalent insertion, while maintaining high cell viability. Compared with conventional grafting-to approaches, these methods significantly improve the efficiency of grafting polymer chains and enable the active manipulation of cellular phenotypes.},

Specificity in this recognition is thought to be essential, whereas promiscuity is often associated with unwanted side effects, poor catalytic properties and errors in biological function. Recent experimental evidence suggests that promiscuity, not only in interactions but also in the actual function of proteins, is not as rare as was previously thought. This has implications not only for our fundamental understanding of molecular recognition and how protein function has evolved over time but also in the realm of biotechnology. Understanding protein promiscuity is becoming increasingly important not only to optimize protein engineering applications in areas as diverse as synthetic biology and metagenomics but also to lower attrition rates in drug discovery programs, identify drug interaction surfaces less susceptible to escape mutations and potentiate the power of polypharmacology.},

Using a simple assay for the initiation of biofilm formation (e.g. attachment to an abiotic surface) by Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS365, we have shown that: (i) P. fluorescens can form biofilms on an abiotic surface when grown on a range of nutrients; (ii) protein synthesis is required for the early events of biofilm formation; (iii) one (or more) extracytoplasmic protein plays a role in interactions with an abiotic surface; (iv) the osmolarity of the medium affects the ability of the cell to form biofilms. We have isolated transposon mutants defective for the initiation of biofilm formation, which we term surface attachment defective (sad). Molecular analysis of the sad mutants revealed that the ClpP protein (a component of the cytoplasmic Clp protease) participates in biofilm formation in this organism. Our genetic analyses suggest that biofilm formation can proceed via multiple, convergent signalling pathways, which are regulated by various environmental signals. Finally, of the 24 sad mutants analysed in this study, only three had defects in genes of known function. This result suggests that our screen is uncovering novel aspects of bacterial physiology.},

The model couples mass balances for substrates and biomass at reactor scale with an individual-based approach for the floc morphology, shape and micro-colony development. Among the novel model processes included are the group attachment/detachment of micro-flocs to the core structure and the clustering of nitrifiers. Simulation results qualitatively describe the formation of micro-colonies of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers and the extracellular polymeric substance produced by heterotrophic microorganisms, as typically observed in fluorescence in situ hybridization images. These results are the first step towards realistic multi-scale multispecies models of the activated sludge wastewater treatment systems and a generic modelling strategy that could be extended to other engineered biological systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to understand the induction more fully, the inducer of bph gene expression was investigated. To identify the inducer molecule, we constructed four deletion mutants of the structural genes and analyzed the inducibility of the bphE gene in each mutant strain. In the wild-type cell and the bphD deletion mutant, the levels of the bphE transcript were enhanced in the presence of biphenyl. On the other hand, in the bphA, bphB, and bphC deletion mutants, levels of the bphE transcript were not enhanced in the presence of biphenyl. These results demonstrated that the series of reactions catalyzed by biphenyl dioxygenase (BphA), dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (BphB), and 2, 3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (BphC) are necessary to convert biphenyl to the inducer. It is known that these reactions convert biphenyl to 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA), and it was found that the expression of the bph genes was induced by purified HOPDA. These results clearly indicate that HOPDA is the inducer of the bph genes in KKS102.},

Therefore, quantitative ormation on the cellular and subcellular dynamics of ions, signaling molecules, and metabolites is critical for functional understanding of organisms. Mass spectrometry is generally used for monitoring ions and metabolites; however, its temporal and spatial resolution are limited. Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized many areas of biology-e.g., fluorescent proteins can report on gene expression or protein localization in real time-yet promoter-based reporters are often slow to report physiologically relevant changes such as calcium oscillations. Therefore, novel tools are required that can be deployed in specific cells and targeted to subcellular compartments in order to quantify target molecule dynamics directly. We require tools that can measure enzyme activities, protein dynamics, and biophysical processes (e.g., membrane potential or molecular tension) with subcellular resolution. Today, we have an extensive suite of tools at our disposal to address these challenges, including translocation sensors, fluorescence-intensity sensors, and Fodierster resonance energy transfer sensors. This review summarizes sensor design principles, provides a database of sensors for more than 70 different analytes/processes, and gives examples of applications in quantitative live cell imaging. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

The presence of these particles was primarily revealed by a low value of the second virial coefficient, and they could be removed by prolonged centrifugation of the alginate solutions. We obtained the fllowing relations between intrinsic viscosity, molecular weight, and radius of gyration of alginate in solutions containing 0.09M sodium chloride and 0.01M sodium fluoride: [h](100mL/g)=2.0×10-5Mw RG(Å)=0.95・Mw0.54 (Mw{$>$}65000) Based on these results it was concluded that the alginate molecules in solution could best be described as very extended random coils with partially free drainage.},

Recent structural and biochemical studies, in combination with direct visualization of unfolding and translocation in single-molecule experiments, have illuminated the molecular mechanisms behind these processes and suggest how remodelling of macromolecular complexes by AAA+ enzymes could occur without global denaturation. In this Review, we discuss the structural and mechanistic features of AAA+ proteases and remodelling machines, focusing on the bacterial ClpXP and ClpX as paradigms.

However, the formation of a soluble protein-detergent complex (PDC) currently relies on empirical screening of detergents, and a stable and functional PDC is often not obtained. To provide a foundation for systematic comparisons between the properties of the detergent micelle and the resulting PDC, a comprehensive set of detergents commonly used for membrane protein studies are systematically investigated. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), micelle shapes and sizes are determined for phosphocholines with 10, 12, and 14 alkyl carbons, glucosides with 8, 9, and 10 alkyl carbons, maltosides with 8, 10, and 12 alkyl carbons, and lysophosphatidyl glycerols with 14 and 16 alkyl carbons. The SAXS profiles are well described by two-component ellipsoid models, with an electron rich outer shell corresponding to the detergent head groups and a less electron dense hydrophobic core composed of the alkyl chains. The minor axis of the elliptical micelle core from these models is constrained by the length of the alkyl chain, and increases by 1.2-1.5 Å per carbon addition to the alkyl chain. The major elliptical axis also increases with chain length; however, the ellipticity remains approximately constant for each detergent series. In addition, the aggregation number of these detergents increases by ∼16 monomers per micelle for each alkyl carbon added. The data provide a comprehensive view of the determinants of micelle shape and size and provide a baseline for correlating micelle properties with protein-detergent interactions.},

We optimized a single‐cell immunofluorescent assay for the carbon fixation enzyme ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) in order to quantify the enzyme by flow cytometry in phytoplankton cells. The criteria for optimization of the immunofluorescent assay for Rubisco in single cells included maximization of Rubisco immunogenicity, minimization of Rubisco diffusion out of the cells, minimization of cell breakage, and maximization of the cell labeling. Several fixatives (cross‐linkers and denaturing) and permeabilizing agents were tested on 26 species of phytoplankton. The only fixative / permeabilizing agent that fulfilled the criteria established for the assay was 96\% ethanol. Phytoplankton cells collected from the field needed further treatment with a strong oxidant to permeabilize ethanolfixed cells and thus allow the antibody probe to access the Rubisco antigen. This study should have a general applicability to the study of other soluble photosynthetic antigens in single phytoplankton cells. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {Organic substances in produced and formation water from coalbed methane (CBM) and gas shale plays from across the USA were examined in this study. Disposal of produced waters from gas extraction in coal and shale is an important environmental issue because of the large volumes of water involved and the variable quality of this water. Organic substances in produced water may be environmentally relevant as pollutants, but have been little studied. Results from five CBM plays and two gas shale plays (including the Marcellus Shale) show a myriad of organic chemicals present in the produced and formation water. Organic compound classes present in produced and formation water in CBM plays include: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heterocyclic compounds, alkyl phenols, aromatic amines, alkyl aromatics (alkyl benzenes, alkyl biphenyls), long-chain fatty acids, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Concentrations of individual compounds range from {$<$}. 1 to 100. μg/L, but total PAHs (the dominant compound class for most CBM samples) range from 50 to 100. μg/L. Total dissolved organic carbon (TOC) in CBM produced water is generally in the 1-4. mg/L range. Excursions from this general pattern in produced waters from individual wells arise from contaminants introduced by production activities (oils, grease, adhesives, etc.). Organic substances in produced and formation water from gas shale unimpacted by production chemicals have a similar range of compound classes as CBM produced water, and TOC levels of about 8. mg/L. However, produced water from the Marcellus Shale using hydraulic fracturing has TOC levels as high as 5500. mg/L and a range of added organic chemicals including, solvents, biocides, scale inhibitors, and other organic chemicals at levels of 1000. s of μg/L for individual compounds. Levels of these hydraulic fracturing chemicals and TOC decrease rapidly over the first 20. days of water recovery and some level of residual organic contaminants remain up to 250. days after hydraulic fracturing. Although the environmental impacts of the organics in produced water are not well defined, results suggest that care should be exercised in the disposal and release of produced waters containing these organic substances into the environment because of the potential toxicity of many of these substances. © 2014 .},

The ability to build up normal carboxysomes is impaired in three (M3, EK6, and D4) of four high-carbon-requiring mutants studied in this work. M3 and EK6 exhibit abundant immature electron-translucent carboxysomes but no mature ones. This finding supports the contention that an open reading frame located 7.5 kb upstream of the gene encoding the large subunit of Rubisco (altered in M3) is involved in the carboxysome composition and confirms the structural role of the small subunit of Rubisco (slightly modified in EK6) in the assembly of these structures. D4 shows few typical carboxysomes and frequent immature types, its genetic lesion affecting the apparently unrelated gene encoding a subunit of phosphoribosyl aminoamidazole carboxylase of the purine biosynthesis pathway. Revertants EK20 (EK6) and RK13 (D4) have normal carboxysomes, which means that the restoration of the ability to grow under low CO2 coincides with the proper assembling of these structures. N5, a transport mutant due to the alteration of the gene encoding subunit 2 of NADH dehydrogenase, shows an increase in the number and size of carboxysomes and frequent bar-shaped ones.},

Such computations made by bacteria to coordinate the action of a population of cells in response to information gathered by a multitude of inputs is a form of collective intelligence. These computations must be robust to fluctuations in both biological, chemical, and physical parameters as well as to operate with energetic efficiency. Given these constraints, what are the limits of computation by bacterial populations and what strategies have evolved to ensure bacterial communities efficiently work together?

  abstract = {Although the use of silicon dioxide (silica) as a constituent of living organisms is mainly restricted to diatoms and sponges, the ways in which this process is controlled by nature continue to inspire and fascinate. Both diatoms and sponges carry out biosilificiation using an organic matrix but they adopt very different strategies. Diatoms use small and heavily modified peptides called silaffins, where the most characteristic feature is a modulation of charge by attaching long chain polyamines (LCPAs) to lysine groups. Free LCPAs can also cooperate with silaffins. Sponges use the enzyme silicatein which is homologous to the cysteine protease cathepsin. Both classes of proteins form higher-order structures which act both as structural templates and mechanistic catalysts for the polycondensation reaction. In both cases, additional proteins are continuously being discovered which modulate the process further. This paper concentrates on the role of these proteins in the biosilification process as well as in various applications, highlighting areas where focus on specific protein properties may provide further insight. The field of biosilification is a crossroads of different disciplines, where insight into the energetics and mechanisms of molecular self-assembly combine with fundamental biology, complex multicomponent colloidal systems, and an impressive array of potential technological applications.},

  abstract = {We investigate the feasibility of using a surrogate-based method to emulate the deformation and detachment behaviour of a biofilm in response to hydrodynamic shear stress. The influence of shear force, growth rate and viscoelastic parameters on the patterns of growth, structure and resulting shape of microbial biofilms was examined. We develop a statistical modelling approach to this problem, using combination of Bayesian Poisson regression and dynamic linear models for the emulation. We observe that the hydrodynamic shear force affects biofilm deformation in line with some literature. Sensitivity results also showed that the expected number of shear events, shear flow, yield coefficient for heterotrophic bacteria and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) stiffness per unit EPS mass are the four principal mechanisms governing the bacteria detachment in this study. The sensitivity of the model parameters is temporally dynamic, emphasising the significance of conducting the sensitivity analysis across multiple time points. The surrogate models are shown to perform well, and produced 480 fold increase in computational efficiency. We conclude that a surrogate-based approach is effective, and resulting biofilm structure is determined primarily by a balance between bacteria growth, viscoelastic parameters and applied shear stress.},

  abstract = {Individual-based (IB) modelling has been widely used for studying the emergence of complex interactions of bacterial biofilms and their environment. We describe the emulation and calibration of an expensive dynamic simulator of an IB model of microbial communities. We used a combination of multivariate dynamic linear models (DLM) and a Gaussian process to estimate the model parameters of our dynamic emulators. The emulators incorporate a smoothly varying and nonstationary trend that is modelled as a deterministic function of explanatory variables while the Gaussian process (GP) is allowed to capture the remaining intrinsic local variations. We applied this emulation strategy for parameter calibration of a newly developed model for simulation of microbial communities against the iDynoMiCS model. The percentage of variance explained for the four outputs biomass concentration, the total number of particles, biofilm average height and surface roughness range between 84—92\% and 97–99\% for univariate and multivariate emulators respectively. The simulation-based sensitivity analysis identified carbon substrate, oxygen concentration and maximum specific growth rate for heterotrophic bacteria as the most critical variables for predictions. The calibration results also indicated a general reduction of uncertainty levels in most of the parameters. The study has helped us identify the tradeoff in using different types of models for microbial simulation. The approach illustrated here provides a tractable and computationally efficient technique for calibrating the parameters of an expensive computer model.},

  abstract = {The ability to make credible simulations of open engineered biological systems is an important step towards the application of scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems in this challenging, complex engineering domain. An important application of this type of knowledge is in the design and management of wastewater treatment systems. One of the crucial aspects of an engineering biology approach to wastewater treatment study is the ability to run a simulation of complex biological communities. However, the simulation of open biological systems is challenging because they often involve a large number of bacteria that ranges from order 1012 (a baby's microbiome) to 1018 (a wastewater treatment plant) individual particles, and are physically complex. Since the models are computationally expensive, and due to computing constraints, the consideration of only a limited set of scenarios is often possible. A simplified approach to this problem is to use a statistical approximation of the simulation ensembles derived from the complex models at a fine scale which will help in reducing the computational burden. Our aim in this paper is to build a cheaper surrogate of an individual-based (IB) model simulation of microbial communities. The paper focuses on how to use an emulator as an effective tool for studying and incorporating microscale processes in a computationally efficient way into macroscale models. The main issue we address is a strategy for emulating high-level summaries from the IB model simulation data. We use a Gaussian process regression model for the emulation. Under cross-validation, the percentage of variance explained for the univariate emulator ranges from 83–99\% and 87–99\% for the multivariate emulators, and for both biofilms and floc. Our emulators show an approximately 220-fold increase in computational efficiency. The sensitivity analyses indicated that substrate nutrient concentration for nitrate, carbon, nitrite and oxygen as well as the maximum growth rate for heterotrophic bacteria are the most important parameters for the predictions. We observe that the performance of the single step emulator depends hugely on the initial conditions and sample size taken for the normal approximation. We believe that the development of an emulator for an IB model is of strategic importance for using microscale understanding to enable macroscale problem solving.},

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of current research into the synthesis and properties of gold nanorods. Interest in rod-shaped nanoparticles stems from their unique optical properties, which can be approximated by Mie-Gans theory. We begin by outlining briefly the origin of the shape-dependent optical properties of rods. The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties. Initial results on the optical properties of such nanocomposites are reviewed. This review is concluded with a section devoted to the future perspectives for gold rods as novel materials. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Metabolic exchange mediates interactions among microbes, helping explain diversity in microbial communities. As these interactions often involve a fitness cost, it is unclear how stable cooperation can emerge. Here we use genome-scale metabolic models to investigate whether the release of “costless” metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producer), can be a prominent driver of intermicrobial interactions. By performing over 2 million pairwise growth simulations of 24 species in a combinatorial assortment of environments, we identify a large space of metabolites that can be secreted without cost, thus generating ample cross-feeding opportunities. In addition to providing an atlas of putative interactions, we show that anoxic conditions can promote mutualisms by providing more opportunities for exchange of costless metabolites, resulting in an overrepresentation of stable ecological network motifs. These results may help identify interaction patterns in natural communities and inform the design of synthetic microbial consortia.},

However, it remains generally unclear whether the production and exchange of metabolites incurs fitness costs to the producing cells and if so, which ecological mechanisms can facilitate a cooperative exchange of metabolites among unrelated individuals. We hypothesized that positive assortment within structured environments can maintain mutualistic cross-feeding. To test this, we engineered Acinetobacter baylyi and Escherichia coli to reciprocally exchange essential amino acids. Interspecific coculture experiments confirmed that non-cooperating types were selectively favoured in spatially unstructured (liquid culture), yet disfavoured in spatially structured environments (agar plates). Both an individual-based model and experiments with engineered genotypes indicated that a segregation of cross-feeders and non-cooperating auxotrophs stabilized cooperative cross-feeding in spatially structured environments. Chemical imaging confirmed that auxotrophs were spatially excluded from cooperative benefits. Together, these results demonstrate that cooperative cross-feeding between different bacterial species is favoured in structured environments such as bacterial biofilms, suggesting this type of interactions might be common in natural bacterial communities.},

These structures consist of proteins constituting a shell that houses a number of enzymes involved in specific metabolic processes. The 1,2-propanediol utilizing microcompartment is assembled from 7 different types of shell proteins, one of which is PduA. It is one of the more abundant components of the shell and intriguingly can form nanotubule-like structures when expressed on its own in the cytoplasm of E. coli. We propose a model that accounts for the size and appearance of these PduA structures and underpin our model using a combinatorial approach. Making strategic mutations at Lys26, Val51 and Arg79, we targeted residues predicted to be important for PduA assembly. We present the effect of the amino acid residue substitution on the phenotype of the PduA higher-order assemblies (TEM) and the crystal structure of the Lys26Asp mutant with one glycerol molecule bound to the central pore. Our results support the view that the hexamer-hexamer interactions seen in PduA crystals persists in the cytoplasmic structures and reveal the profound influence of the two key amino acids, Lys26 and Arg79, on tiling, not only in the crystal lattice but also in the bacterial cytoplasm. Understanding and controlling PduA assemblies is valuable in order to inform manipulation for synthetic biology and biotechnological applications.},

Here, we developed MiSiC, a general deep-learning-based 2D segmentation method that automatically segments single bacteria in complex images of interacting bacterial communities with very little parameter adjustment, independent of the microscopy settings and imaging modality. Using a bacterial predator-prey interaction model, we demonstrate that MiSiC enables the analysis of interspecies interactions, resolving processes at subcellular scales and discriminating between species in millimeter size datasets. The simple implementation of MiSiC and the relatively low need in computing power make its use broadly accessible to fields interested in bacterial interactions and cell biology.},

By using the freeze-gelation technique, living cells can be immobilized within a mechanically and chemically stable ceramic-like matrix. Due to a freeze-drying step, the embedded microorganisms are converted into a preserved form. In that way, they can be stored under dry conditions, which comply better with storage, transport, and handling requirements. Thus, in contrast to other immobilization techniques, there is no need for storage in liquid or under humid atmosphere. The biological activity, mechanical strength, and the structure of the biologically active ceramic-like composites (biocers) produced by freeze gelation have been investigated by using the phenol-degrading bacteria Rhodococcus ruber as model organism. Samples of freeze-gelation biocers have been investigated after defined storage periods, demonstrating nearly unchanged mechanical strength of the immobilization matrix as well as good storage stability of the activity of the immobilized cells over several months of storage at 4 °C. Repeated-batch tests demonstrated further that the freeze-gelation biocers can be repeatedly used over a period of more than 12 months without losing its bioactivity. Thus, these results show that freeze-gelation biocers have high potential of being scaled up from laboratory test systems to applications in real environment because of their long bioactivity as well as mechanical stability.},

Neutral phosphatidylcholine vesicles showed only a limited capacity to fuse. Vesicles containing lipids that were in a liquid-crystalline state were more susceptible to fusion than vesicles composed of lipids that were in the solid phase at experimental temperatures. Incorporation of equimolar amounts of cholesterol into vesicles composed of lipids in a liquid-crystalline state suppressed their ability to fuse. Calorimetric measuremens revealed Ca2+ induced segregation of individual lipids to form separate domains within the vesicle membrane (phase separation).

The partial specific volume determined independently by density measurements and by the contrast variation method was found to be 0.9125 mL 8-l at 20 "C, and a molecular weight of 95 700 dalton was assigned to this monodisperse solution of Triton X-100 (pH 8.0). A higher molecular weight of 150000 dalton was found at 30 "C at pH 8.0 in 0.01 M Tris-HCI; this particle had a radius of gyration of 39.2 A, a volume of 4.42 X lo5 A3, and a degree of hydration of 1.21 g of water per gram of Triton X-100. The radius of gyration of the 95700 dalton particle was found to be 29.3 A; the volume was 3.35 X lo5 A3 with a degree of hydration of 1.18 g of water per gram of Triton X-100. The largest dimensions of the Triton X-100 particle were determined from the correlation functions and were 105 A at 20 "C and 119 8, at 30 "C. For both particles the scattering curves are more consistent with an oblate ellipsoid of revolution rather than a prolate equivalent. From small-angle X-ray scattering experiments at various electron densities of the solvent the mean-square electron fluctuation was determined from which a high electron density and a low electron density region within the Triton X-100 particle can be proposed. If a two-level step function is assumed, the radius of gyration of the high electron density region is 18 A for the 95 700 dalton particle and 22.7 A for the 150000 dalton molecule, indicating that the hydrocarbon core of the 95 700 dalton particle has a diameter of 48.0 A, whereas the hydrocarbon core of the 150 000 dalton particle is asymmetric with half axes of a = 23.4 A and b = 46.8 A. The average curvature of the external surface area of the Triton X-100 micelle at 293 K is considerably smaller (28 A) than the average radius obtained from the radius of gyration, indicating that the external surface is convoluted. Laser correlation spectroscopy from aqueous solutions of Triton X-100 at 20 and 30 "C in the concentration range 5-10 mg/mL was carried out in addition to small-angle X-ray scattering experiments. The micellar size at 20 "C corresponds to an effective hydrodynamic radius of 41.8 A, and that at 30 "C of 55.7 A, with translational diffusion coefficients of (4.92 f 0.08) X (20 "C) and (4.15 f 0.06) X cm2 s-l (30 "C).},

  abstract = {Microencapsulation involves coating or entrapping of a core material with a polymeric material to generate microspheres in the size range of 1-1000 μm. This versatile technology has been used to encapsulate a wide array of products such as pharmaceuticals, flavors, volatile oils, plant extracts, enzymes and others. In the recent decades, this technology has also been applied to the area of microbial cell immobilization owing to its numerous advantages over other cell immobilization techniques such as higher cell loading capacity, enhanced cell survival and increased production rate of the desired microbial products. The confinement of microbial cells within a semipermeable polymeric matrix enables the physical isolation of cells from the external environment while maintaining a hospitable internal micro-environment. It has found application in various biotechnological processes such as probiotic encapsulation in food industries, in biotransformation and fermentation processes producing antibiotics, organic acids, enzymes, and alcohols as well as environmental decontamination such as waste water treatment. The judicious selection of materials and methods for the production of microspheres is critical for ensuring minimum damage to the viability of the encapsulated microbial cells. The conventional methods used for microencapsulation of microbial cells are reviewed along with the recent advances in the respective methods. The effect of microencapsulation on the microbial cells, the stability of the microspheres as well as the techniques for enumeration of the encapsulated cells are also discussed, followed by a summary of recent applications of microencapsulation in different biotechnological processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A 2-3 log decrease in cfu occurred in the presence, but not absence, of added naphthalene. We used aqueous suspensions of crystalline naphthalene to explore potential mechanisms of its toxicity on the test bacterium under aerobic conditions. Measurements of dissolved naphthalene in medium indicated that uptake by P. putida NCIB 9816-4 maintained naphthalene at concentrations well below saturation. Accumulation of catechol was documented by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in the presence of 0.5\% (w/v) naphthalene crystals. Transient catechol accumulation was highest when cells entered stationary phase. A decrease in catechol concentration correlated with the development of brown color in the medium. Brown pigment accumulation correlated with a decrease in viable cell counts. These results suggested that catechol, related compounds, and their condensation products can accumulate to toxic levels in stationary phase P. putida NCIB 9816-4 cells. We hypothesize that the same mechanism of toxicity may occur under the nutrient-limited conditions expected in soil.},

Alginate beads containing Ad were used for transduction of U343 glioma cells and the transduction efficiency of the alginate beads was measured by quantification of gene expression using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter at different time points. In vitro results of gene expression revealed that the Ad encapsulated in the alginate beads with 0.5 wt\% of alginate concentration exhibited a high activity for a long period (over 7 days) and was released in a sustained manner from the alginate beads.

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Nature has developed a fascinating strategy of cryptobiosis ("secret life") for counteracting the stressful, and often lethal, environmental conditions that fluctuate sporadically over time. For example, certain bacteria sporulate to transform from a metabolically active, vegetative state to an ametabolic endospore state. The bacterial endospores, encased within tough biomolecular shells, withstand the extremes of harmful stressors, such as radiation, desiccation, and malnutrition, for extended periods of time and return to a vegetative state by breaking their protective shells apart when their environment becomes hospitable for living. Certain ciliates and even higher organisms, for example, tardigrades, and others are also found to adopt a cryptobiotic strategy for survival. A common feature of cryptobiosis is the structural presence of tough sheaths on cellular structures. However, most cells and cellular assemblies are not "spore-forming" and are vulnerable to the outside threats. In particular, mammalian cells, enclosed with labile lipid bilayers, are highly susceptible to in vitro conditions in the laboratory and daily life settings, making manipulation and preservation difficult outside of specialized conditions. The instability of living cells has been a main bottleneck to the advanced development of cell-based applications, such as cell therapy and cell based sensors. A judicious question arises: can cellular tolerance against harmful stresses be enhanced by simply forming cell-in shell hybrid structures? Experimental results suggest that the answer is yes. A micrometer-sized "Iron Man" can be generated by chemically forming an ultrathin ({$<$}100 nm) but durable shell on a "non-spore-forming" cell.\textbackslash rSince the report on silica nanoencapsulation of yeast cells, in which cytoprotective yeast-in-silica hybrids were formed, several synthetic strategies have been developed to encapsulate individual cells in a cytocompatible fashion, mimicking the cryptobiotic cell-in-shell structures found in nature, for example, bacterial endospores. Bioinspired silicification and phenolics-based coatings are, so far, the main approaches to the formation of cytoprotective cell-in-shell hybrids, because they ensure cell viability during encapsulations and also generate durable nanoshells on cell surfaces. The resulting cell-in-shell hybrids extrinsically possess enhanced resistance to external aggressors, and more intriguingly, the encapsulation alters their metabolic activity, exemplified by retarded or suppressed cell cycle progression. In addition, recent developments in the field have further advanced the synthetic tools available to the stage of chemical sporulation and germination of mammalian cells, where cytoprotective shells are formed on labile mammalian cells and broken apart on demand. For example, individual HeLa cells are coated with a metal-organic complex of ferric ion and tannic acid, and cellular adherence and proliferation are controlled by the programmed shell formation and degradation. Based on these demonstrations, the (degradable) cell-in-shell hybrids are anticipated to find their applications in various biomedical and bionanotechnological areas, such as cytotherapeutics, high-throughput screening, sensors, and biocatalysis, as well as providing a versatile research platform for single-cell biology.},

Signal gain arises through cooperative action of chemoreceptors of different types. The signaling-teams within a receptor cluster may be built from trimers of receptor dimers that communicate through shared connections to their partner signaling proteins. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'.},

Persons especially at risk occupationally are those engaged in thermal processing of oil shale, coal, and heavy residual petroleum. It has been shown that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons require metabolic activation before they can act as mutagens or carcinogens. This metabolic activation results from interaction with microsomal enzymes present in many body cells, yielding reactive epoxides which react with DNA and produce mutations in the count frame shift or participate in covalent bounding. While opinions differ regarding the relative role of these processes in mutagenesis, considerable evidence exists which links mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Metabolites of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are carcinogenic are usually mutagenic, which supports the hypothesis that damage to chromosomes plays an important role in carcinogenesis. These facts open the possibility to monitoring the spread of carcinogenic substances in the biosphere by relatively simple tests whose endpoint is mutagenesis.},

In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user.

  abstract = {A Pseudomonas sp. strain NGKI (NCIM 5120) capable of degrading naphthalene was immobilized in polyurethane foam. The naphthalene-degrading activity of the freely suspended cells was compared with that of immobilized cells in batches in shaken culture and in a continuous culture system in a packed-bed reactor. Increasing concentrations of naphthalene were better tolerated and more quickly degraded by immobilized cell cultures than by free cells. An initial naphthalene concentration of 25 mM was completely degraded by freely suspended cells (4 x 10(10) cfu ml(-1)) and polyurethane-foam-immobilized cells (0.8-1 x 10(12) cfu g(-1) foam cubes) after 4 days and 2 days of incubation, respectively. Free cells degraded a maximum of 30 mM naphthalene after 4 days of incubation with 50 mM naphthalene, and no further degradation was observed even after 15 days of incubation, whereas foam-immobilized cells brought about the complete degradation of 50 mM initial naphthalene after 6 days of incubation. Furthermore, with 25 mM naphthalene, the polyurethane-foam-immobilized cells were re-used 45 times over a period of 90 days without losing naphthalene-degrading activity. By contrast, with the same amount of naphthalene, alginate-, agar-, and polyacrylamide-entrapped cells could be reused for 18, 12, and 23 times over a period of 44, 28, and 50 days, respectively. During continuous degradation in a packed-bed reactor, foam-immobilized cells degraded 80 mM naphthalene at a rate of 150 ml(-1) h(-1). With the same flow rate and 40 mM naphthalene, this system operated efficiently and continuously for about 120 days, whereas the packed-bed reactor with alginate-, agar-, and polyacrylamide-entrapped cells could be operated only for 45, 40, and 60 days respectively. Thus, more efficient degradation of naphthalene could be achieved by immobilizing cells of Pseudomonas sp. strain NGK1 in polyurethane foam, rather than in the other matrices tested.},

  abstract = {An emerging principle of cell biology is the regulated conversion of macromolecules between soluble and condensed states. To screen for such regulation of the cyanobacterial proteome, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins that change solubility during the day-night cycle. We find a set of night-insoluble proteins that includes many enzymes in essential metabolic pathways. Using time-lapse microscopy and isotope labeling, we show that these proteins reversibly transition between punctate structures at night and a soluble state during the day without substantial degradation. We find that the cyanobacterial circadian clock regulates the kinetics of puncta formation during the night and that the appearance of puncta indicates the metabolic status of the cell. Reversible condensation of specific enzymes is thus a regulated response to the day-night cycle and may reflect a general bacterial strategy used in fluctuating growth conditions.},

Tremendous progress has been made in this field since and this review attempts to capture, with selected examples from the literature, the key advances in synthesising and controlling properties of silica-based materials using bioinspired approaches, i.e. conditions of near-neutral pH, all aqueous environments and room temperature. One important reason to investigate biosilicifying systems is to be able to develop novel materials and/or technologies suitable for a wide range of applications. Therefore, this review will also focus on applications arising from research on biological and bioinspired silica. A range of applications such as in the areas of sensors, coatings, hybrid materials, catalysis and biocatalysis and drug delivery have started appearing. Furthermore, scale-up of this technology suitable for large-scale manufacturing has proven the potential of biologically inspired synthesis.},

We report the first X-ray structure for this family, which is a novel fold (termed the 'Toblerone' fold) that likely evolved via the concatenation of monomers of the trimeric YjgF superfamily and the acquisition of a metal binding site. Structures of AtzD with bound substrate (cyanuric acid) and inhibitors (phosphate, barbituric acid and melamine), along with mutagenesis studies, allowed the identification of the active site. The AtzD monomer, active site and substrate all possess threefold rotational symmetry, to the extent that the active site possesses three potential Ser-Lys catalytic dyads. A single catalytic dyad (Ser85-Lys42) is hypothesized, based on biochemical evidence and crystallographic data. A plausible catalytic mechanism based on these observations is also presented. A comparison with a homology model of the related barbiturase, Bar, was used to infer the active-site residues responsible for substrate specificity, and the phylogeny of the 68 AtzD-like enzymes in the database were analysed in light of this structure-function relationship.},

We present the design of a novel multi-input microfluidic reactor, capable of substrate feeding at multiple points, as a first step towards overcoming these problems in a continuous-flow setting. Using the transketolase-(TK) catalysed reaction of lithium hydroxypyruvate (HPA) and glycolaldehyde (GA) to l-erythrulose (ERY), we demonstrate the transposition of a fed-batch substrate feeding strategy to our microfluidic reactor.

In addition, the aforementioned findings allowed the preparation of novel materials with enhanced optical and mechanical properties.

  abstract = {The development of sol-gel based processes for the encapsulation of living cells is a challenging task where the host material must be optimized both in terms of intrinsic properties and impact on cell viability. Here, the mechanical stability of silica hosts obtained via a mixed aqueous route based on sodium silicate-silica nanoparticle mixtures could be improved by increasing the relative content of molecular precursors over colloidal silica. The specific surface area, pore volume and diffusion properties of the host were also modified. Moreover, this resulted in an increase in the ionic strength, inducing high osmolarity that is detrimental to encapsulated Escherichia coli bacteria. Glycine betaine, a well-known E. coli osmoprotector, could be successfully used as an additive to the sol-gel formulation to limit this osmotic stress. Compared to the previously studied glycerol additive, glycine betaine was found more efficient to preserve the bacterial viability. Moreover, this efficiency was obtained with much lower amounts of glycine betaine, whose addition has therefore no detrimental impact on the silica host structure. These data provide new information about the different cellular stresses resulting from the sol-gel encapsulation process and demonstrate the importance of combining chemical and biological approaches to design more robust functional ``living'' materials.},

  abstract = {Sol-gel encapsulation of living cells within inorganic matrices is an area of great scientific and technological interest. However, only recently a two-step procedure allowing population growth inside the hydrogel matrix has been proposed. In conventional one-pot encapsulations, space limitation suffered by confined cells makes their division completely impossible, and only intrinsic resistant microorganisms (mainly bacteria and yeasts) were encapsulated using extremely biocompatible synthesis procedures in order to obtain an acceptable viability in the resulting biomaterial. The two-step procedure based on a pre-encapsulation of the biological guest within Ca(II)-alginate, has proved to be a versatile method for advanced biomaterials development. For instance, in applications were it is necessary to keep a large number of metabolically active cells to render them efficient, or where the encapsulation of actively growing cells may be required. Moreover, it opened up many different possibilities to biomaterials, allowing the encapsulation of higher organisms cells (more sensitive than microorganism) as carrot phloematic tissue and tobacco BY2 Line or even of multicellular organisms, such as filamentous fungi. On the other hand, while one-pot encapsulations uses almost exclusively silica hydrogel hosts, the protection conferred to the cells by the pre-encapsulation step during the sol-gel synthesis procedure allows to extend this approach to other sol-gel materials, as has recently been addressed for Al(III) and Zr(IV) oxohydroxide hydrogels. This work constitutes the first observation of Escherichia coli growth within such metal oxide hydrogels, giving clear evidence that sol-gel based cell encapsulation can now be envisioned within a wide variety of metal oxide hosts through the optimization of the preencapsulation environment. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

  abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is an optical phenomena generated by light when it interacts with conductive nanoparticles (NPs) that are smaller than the incident wavelength. As in surface plasmon resonance, the electric field of incident light can be deposited to collectively excite electrons of a conduction band, with the result being coherent localized plasmon oscillations with a resonant frequency that strongly depends on the composition, size, geometry, dielectric environment and separation distance of NPs. This review serves to describe the physical theory of LSPR formation at the surface of nanostructures, and the potential for this optical technology to serve as a basis for the development bioassays and biosensing of high sensitivity. The benefits and challenges associated with various experimental designs of nanoparticles and detection systems, as well as creative approaches that have been developed to improve sensitivity and limits of detection are highlighted using examples from the literature. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the complexity of circadian clocks in higher organisms has prevented a clear understanding of how natural environmental conditions affect circadian clocks and their physiological outputs. Here, we dissect the interaction between circadian regulation and responses to fluctuating light in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. We demonstrate that natural changes in light intensity substantially affect the expression of hundreds of circadian-clock-controlled genes, many of which are involved in key steps of metabolism. These changes in expression arise from circadian and lightresponsive control of RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters by a network of transcription factors including RpaA and RpaB. Using phenomenological modeling constrained by our data, we reveal simple principles that underlie the small number of stereotyped responses of dusk circadian genes to changes in light.},

  abstract = {The use of equilibrium expressions for sorption to natural particles in fate and transport models is often invalid due to slow kinetics. This paper reviews recent research into the causes of slow sorption and desorption rates at the intraparticle level and how this phenomenon relates to contaminant transport, bio-availability, and remediation. Sorption kinetics are complex and poorly predictable at present. Diffusion limitations appear to play a major role. Contending mechanisms include diffusion through natural organic matter matrices and diffusion through intraparticle nanopores. These mechanisms probably operate si-multaneously, but the relative importance of each in a given system is indeterminate. Sorption shows anomalous behaviors that are presently not well explained by the simple diffusion models, including concentration dependence of the slow fraction, distributed rate constants, and kinetic hysteresis. Research is needed to determine whether adsorp-tion/desorption bond energies may play a role along with molecular diffusion in slow kinetics. The pos-sible existence of high-energy adsorption sites both within the internal matrix of organic matter and in nanopores is discussed. Sorption can be rate-limiting to biodegradation, bioavailablity, and subsurface transport of contaminants. Characterization of mech-anism is thus critical for fate and risk assessment. Studies are needed to measure desorption kinetics under digestive and respiratory conditions in receptor organisms. Conditions under which the constraint of slow desorption may be overcome are discussed, including the addition of biological or chemical agents, the application of heat, and the physical alteration of the soil.},

Consequently, there is great interest in understanding effects of solution conditions on protein stability, as well as in developing strategies to improve protein stability in desired reaction media. Recent methods include novel chemical modifications of protein, lyophilization in the presence of additives, and physical immobilization on novel supports. Rational and combinatorial protein engineering techniques have been used to yield unmodified proteins with exceptionally improved stability. Both have been aided by the development of computational tools and structure-guided heuristics aimed at reducing library sizes that must be generated and screened to identify improved mutants. The number of parameters used to indicate protein stability can complicate discussions and investigations, and care should be taken to identify whether thermodynamic or kinetic stability limits the observed stability of proteins. Although the useful lifetime of a biocatalyst is dictated by its kinetic stability, only 6\% of protein stability studies use kinetic stability measures. Clearly, more effort is needed to study how solution conditions impact protein kinetic stability. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {ClpP is the proteolytic subunit of the ATP-dependent Clp protease in eubacteria, mammals and plant chloroplasts. Cyanobacterial ClpP protein is encoded by a multigene family, producing up to four distinct isozymes. We have examined the importance of the first ClpP protein (ClpP1) isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 for acclimation to ecologically relevant UV-B and low-temperature regimens. When the growth light of 50 mumol photons m-2 s-1 was supplemented with 0.5 W m-2 UV-B for 8 h, the constitutive level of ClpP1 rose eightfold after an initial lag of 1 h. Wild-type cells readily acclimated to this UV-B level, recovering after the initial stress to almost the same growth rate as that before UV-B exposure. Growth of a clpP1 null mutant (delta clpP1), however, was severely inhibited by UV-B, being eight times slower than the wild type after 8 h. In comparison, ClpP1 content increased 15-fold in wild-type cultures shifted from 37 degree C to 25 degree C for 24 h. Wild-type cultures readily acclimated to 25 degree C after 24 h, whereas the delta clpP1 strain did not and eventually lost viability with prolonged cold treatment. During acclimation to either UV-B or cold, photosynthesis in the wild type was initially inhibited upon the shift but then recovered. Photosynthesis in delta clpP1 cultures, however, was more severely inhibited by the stress treatment and failed to recover. Acclimation was also monitored by examining the exchange of photosystem II reaction centre D1 proteins that occurs in wild-type Synechococcus during conditions of excitation stress. During both cold and UV-B shifts, wild-type cultures replaced the acclimative form of D1 (D1:1) with the alternative D1 form 2 (D1:2) within the first hours. Once acclimated to either 25 degree C or 0.5 W m-2 UV-B, D1:2 was exchanged back for D1:1.

Our results demonstrate that the ATP-dependent Clp protease is an essential component of the cold and UV-B acclimation processes of Synechococcus.},

  abstract = {The heat shock protein ClpB is essential for acquired thermotolerance in cyanobacteria and eukaryotes and belongs to a diverse group of polypeptides which function as molecular chaperones. In this study we show that ClpB is also strongly induced during moderate cold stress in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. A fivefold increase in ClpB (92 kDa) content occurred when cells were acclimated to 25°C over 24 h after being shifted from the optimal growth temperature of 37°C. A corresponding increase occurred for the smaller ClpB (78 kDa), which arises from a second translational start within the clpB gene of prokaryotes. Shifts to more extreme cold (i.e., 20 and 15°C) progressively decreased the level of ClpB induction, presumably due to retardation of protein synthesis within this relatively cold-sensitive strain. Inactivation of clpB in Synechococcus sp. increased the extent of inhibition of photosynthesis upon the shift to 25°C and markedly reduced the mutant's ability to acclimate to the new temperature regime, with a threefold drop in growth rate. Furthermore, around 30\% fewer clpB cells survived the shift to 25°C after 24 h compared to the wild type, and more of the mutant cells were also arrested during cell division at 25°C, remaining attached after septum formation. Development of a cold thermotolerance assay based on cell survival clearly demonstrated that wild-type cells could acquire substantial resistance to the nonpermissive temperature of 15°C by being pre-exposed to 25°C. The same level of cold thermotolerance, however, occurred in the clpB strain, indicating ClpB induction is not necessary for this form of thermal resistance in Synechococcus spp. Overall, our results demonstrate that the induction of ClpB contributes significantly to the acclimation process of cyanobacteria to permissive low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Proteolysis functions as a precise regulatory mechanism for a broad spectrum of cellular processes. Such control impacts not only on the stability of key metabolic enzymes but also on the effective removal of terminally damaged polypeptides. Much of this directed protein turnover is performed by proteases that require ATP and, of those in bacteria, the Clp protease from Escherichia coli is one of the best characterized to date. The Clp holoenzyme consists of two adjacent heptameric rings of the proteolytic subunit known as ClpP, which are flanked by a hexameric ring of a regulatory subunit from the Clp/Hsp100 chaperone family at one or both ends. The recently resolved three-dimensional structure of the E. coli ClpP protein has provided new insights into its interaction with the regulatory/chaperone subunits. In addition, an increasing number of studies over the last few years have recognized the added complexity and functional importance of ClpP proteins in other eubacteria and, in particular, in photosynthetic organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to higher plants. The goal of this review is to summarize these recent findings and to highlight those areas that remain unresolved.},

  abstract = {The removal of cell-bound water through air drying and the addition of water to air-dried cells are forces that have played a pivotal role in the evolution of the prokaryotes. In bacterial cells that have been subjected to air drying, the evaporation of free cytoplasmic water (Vf) can be instantaneous, and an equilibrium between cell-bound water (Vb) and the environmental water (vapor) potential (psi wv) may be achieved rapidly. In the air-dried state some bacteria survive only for seconds whereas others can tolerate desiccation for thousands, perhaps millions, of years. The desiccated (anhydrobiotic) cell is characterized by its singular lack of water--with contents as low as 0.02 g of H2O g (dry weight)-1. At these levels the monolayer coverage by water of macromolecules, including DNA and proteins, is disturbed. As a consequence the mechanisms that confer desiccation tolerance upon air-dried bacteria are markedly different from those, such as the mechanism of preferential exclusion of compatible solutes, that preserve the integrity of salt-, osmotically, and freeze-thaw-stressed cells. Desiccation tolerance reflects a complex array of interactions at the structural, physiological, and molecular levels. Many of the mechanisms remain cryptic, but it is clear that they involve interactions, such as those between proteins and co-solvents, that derive from the unique properties of the water molecule. A water replacement hypothesis accounts for how the nonreducing disaccharides trehalose and sucrose preserve the integrity of membranes and proteins. Nevertheless, we have virtually no insight into the state of the cytoplasm of an air-dried cell. There is no evidence for any obvious adaptations of proteins that can counter the effects of air drying or for the occurrence of any proteins that provide a direct and a tangible contribution to cell stability. Among the prokaryotes that can exist as anhydrobiotic cells, the cyanobacteria have a marked capacity to do so. One form, Nostoc commune, encompasses a number of the features that appear to be critical to the withstanding of a long-term water deficit, including the elaboration of a conspicuous extracellular glycan, synthesis of abundant UV-absorbing pigments, and maintenance of protein stability and structural integrity. There are indications of a growing technology for air-dried cells and enzymes. Paradoxically, desiccation tolerance of bacteria has virtually been ignored for the past quarter century. The present review considers what is known, and what is not known, about desiccation, a phenomenon that impinges upon every facet of the distributions and activities of prokaryotic cells.},

Here we revisit the first synthetic genetic oscillator, the repressilator, and modify it using principles from stochastic chemistry in single cells. Specifically, we sought to reduce error propagation and information losses, not by adding control loops, but by simply removing existing features. We show that this modification created highly regular and robust oscillations. Furthermore, some streamlined circuits kept 14 generation periods over a range of growth conditions and kept phase for hundreds of generations in single cells, allowing cells in flasks and colonies to oscillate synchronously without any coupling between them. Our results suggest that even the simplest synthetic genetic networks can achieve a precision that rivals natural systems, and emphasize the importance of noise analyses for circuit design in synthetic biology.},

  abstract = {One promise of synthetic biology is the creation of genetic circuitry that enables the execution of logical programming in living cells. Such wet programming'is positioned to transform a wide and diverse swathe of biotechnology ranging from therapeutics and diagnostics to water treatment strategies. Although progress in the development of a library of genetic modules continues apace, a major challenge for their integration into larger circuits is the generation of sufficiently fast and precise communication between modules. An attractive approach is to integrate engineered circuits with host processes that facilitate robust cellular signalling. In this context, recent studies have demonstrated that bacterial protein degradation can trigger a precise response to stress by overloading a limited supply of intracellular proteases. Here we use protease competition to engineer rapid and tunable coupling of genetic circuits across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We characterize coupling delay times that are more than an order of magnitude faster than standard transcription-factor-based coupling methods (less than 1 min compared with 1/420-40 min) and demonstrate tunability through manipulation of the linker between the protein and its degradation tag. We use this mechanism as a platform to couple genetic clocks at the intracellular and colony level, then synchronize the multi-colony dynamics to reduce variability in both clocks. We show how the coupled clock network can be used to encode independent environmental inputs into a single time series output, thus enabling frequency multiplexing (information transmitted on a common channel by distinct frequencies) in a genetic circuit context. Our results establish a general framework for the rapid and tunable coupling of genetic circuits through the use of native queueing'processes such as competitive protein degradation. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The recrystallized S layer proteins and the S layer/DPPE layers could be chemically cross-linked from the subphase with glutaraldehyde. This cross-linking step enhanced the stability of the recrystallized S layer protein films and the composite S layer/DPPE layers considerably for subsequent handling procedures. By transferring a second phospholipid film onto the S layer/DPPE layers it was possible to mimic the structural principle of those archaeobacterial cell envelopes which are exclusively composed of a plasma membrane and a closely associated S layer. The high stability of S layer supported lipid membranes and the possibility for producing this composite structure on a large scale by standard LB techniques open new ways for exploiting structural and functional principles of membrane associated and integrated molecules. ?? 1994.},

They are monomolecular arrays composed of a single protein or glycoprotein species and represent the simplest biological membranes developed during evolution. They are highly porous protein mesh works with unit cell sizes in the range of 3 to 30 nm, and pore sizes of 2 to 8 nm. S-layers are usually 5 to 20 nm thick (in archaea, up to 70 nm). S-layer proteins are one of the most abundant biopolymers on earth. One of their key features, and the focus of this review, is the intrinsic capability of isolated native and recombinant S-layer proteins to form self-assembled mono- or double layers in suspension, at solid supports, the air-water interface, planar lipid films, liposomes, nanocapsules, and nanoparticles. The reassembly is entropy-driven and a fascinating example of matrix assembly following a multistage, non-classical pathway in which the process of S-layer protein folding is directly linked with assembly into extended clusters. Moreover, basic research on the structure, synthesis, genetics, assembly, and function of S-layer proteins laid the foundation for their application in novel approaches in biotechnology, biomimetics, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {Determining the extent to which Symbiodinium communities in corals are inherited versus environmentally acquired is fundamental to understanding coral resilience and to predicting coral responses to stressors like warming oceans that disrupt this critical endosymbiosis. We examined the fidelity with which Symbiodinium communities in the brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix are vertically transmitted and the extent to which communities are genetically regulated, by genotyping the symbiont communities within 60 larvae and their parents (9 maternal and 45 paternal colonies) using high-throughput sequencing of the ITS2 locus. Unexpectedly, Symbiodinium communities associated with brooded larvae were distinct from those within parent colonies, including the presence of types not detected in adults. Bayesian heritability (h2) analysis revealed that 33\% of variability in larval Symbiodinium communities was genetically controlled. Results highlight flexibility in the establishment of larval symbiont communities and demonstrate that symbiont transmission is not exclusively vertical in brooding corals. Instead, we show that Symbiodinium transmission in S. hystrix involves a mixed-mode strategy, similar to many terrestrial invertebrate symbioses. Also, variation in the abundances of common Symbiodinium types among adult corals suggests that microhabitat differences influence the structure of in hospite Symbiodinium communities. Partial genetic regulation coupled with flexibility in the environmentally acquired component of Symbiodinium communities implies that corals with vertical transmission, like S. hystrix, may be more resilient to environmental change than previously thought.},

  abstract = {An hypothesis is proposed to explain the damage caused to biological membranes exposed to low temperatures. The thesis rests on the general observation that the lipid components of most membranes are heterogeneous and undergo phase transitions from gel-phase lamellae to liquid-crystalline lamellae and some to a non lamellar, hexagonal-II phase over a wide range of temperatures. As a consequence of these phase transitions the lateral distribution of the lipids characteristic of the growth temperature is disturbed and redistribution takes place on the basis of the temperature at which phase transitions occur. When membranes are cooled, first the non-lamellar forming lipids pass through a transition to a fluid lamellar phase and are miscible with bilayer-forming lipids into which they diffuse. On further cooling the high-melting-point lipids begin to crystallize and separate into a lamellar gel phase, in the process excluding the low-melting point lipids and intrinsic proteins. The lipids in these remaining regions form a gel phase at the lowest temperature. It is suggested that, because the nonlamellar lipids tend to undergo a liquid-crystalline to gel-phase transition at higher temperatures than lamellar-forming lipids, these will tend to phase separate into a gel phase domain rich in these lipids. Damage results when the membrane is reheated, whereupon the hexagonal-II-forming lipids give rise to nonlamellar structures. These probably take the form of inverted micelles sandwiched within the lipid bilayer and they completely destroy the permeability barrier properties of the membrane. The model is consistent with the phase behavior of membrane lipids and the action of cryoprotective agents in modifying lipid phase properties. © 1985.},

  abstract = {Biological membranes consist of a complex assortment of lipids and proteins. The arrangement of the components, particularly in regard to their lateral disposition in the plane of the membrane under physiological conditions, is dependent on the phase behavior of the different membrane lipids and the way that this behavior is modified by interaction with other membrane components and electrolytes in the aqueous medium. Irreversible phase separation of components within the membrane may result from exposure to extreme environmental conditions including temperature, pressure, or electrolyte concentration. The principles underlying the phase-mixing behavior of model membrane systems can be used to provide useful information about the factors that determine the stability of biomembranes under physiological and non-physiological conditions. These data are reviewed and used to predict events that take place when membranes are exposed to environmental stress.},

  abstract = {\{©\} 2015 Radian et al.Chlorinated isocyanuric acids are widely used water disinfectants that generate hypochlorite, but with repeated application, they build up cyanuric acid (CYA) that must be removed to maintain disinfection. 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-treated Escherichia coli cells expressing cyanuric acid hydrolase (CAH) from Moorella thermoacetica exhibited significantly high CYA degradation rates and provided protection against enzyme inactivation by hypochlorite (chlorine). APTES coating or encapsulation of cells had two benefits: (i) overcoming diffusion limitations imposed by the cell wall and (ii) protecting against hypochlorite inactivation of CAH activity. Cells encapsulated in APTES gels degraded CYA three times faster than nonfunctionalized tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) gels, and cells coated with APTES degraded CYA at a rate of 29mol/min per mg of CAH protein, similar to the rate with purified enzyme. UV spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy showed that the higher rates were due to APTES increasing membrane permeability and enhancing cyanuric acid diffusion into the cytoplasm to reach the CAH enzyme. Purified CAH enzyme was shown to be rapidly inactivated by hypochlorite. APTES aggregates surrounding cells protected via the amine groups reacting with hypochlorite as shown by pH changes, zeta potential measurements, and infrared spectroscopy. APTES-encapsulated E. coli cells expressing CAH degraded cyanuric acid at high rates in the presence of 1 to 10 ppm hypochlorite, showing effectiveness under swimming pool conditions. In contrast, CAH activity in TEOS gels or free cells was completely inactivated by hypochlorite. These studies show that commercially available silica materials can selectively enhance, protect, and immobilize whole-cell biocatalysts for specialized applications. IMPORTANCE Hypochlorite is used in vast quantities for water disinfection, killing bacteria on surfaces, and washing and whitening. In pools, spas, and other waters, hypochlorite is frequently delivered as chlorinated isocyanuric acids that release hypochlorite and cyanuric acid. Over time, cyanuric acid accumulates and impairs disinfection and must be removed. The microbial enzyme cyanuric acid hydrolase can potentially remove cyanuric acid to restore disinfection and protect swimmers. Whole bacterial cells expressing cyanuric acid hydrolase were encapsulated in an inert silica matrix containing an amine group. The amine group serves to permeabilize the cell membrane and accelerate cyanuric acid degradation, and it also reacts with hypochlorite to protect against inactivation of cyanuric acid hydrolase. Methods for promoting whole-cell biocatalysis are important in biotechnology, and the present work illustrates approaches to enhance rates and protect against an inhibitory substance.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Cyanobacteria are the globally dominant photoautotrophic lineage. Their success is dependent on a set of adaptations collectively termed the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM). The purpose of the CCM is to support effective CO2 fixation by enhancing the chemical conditions in the vicinity of the primary CO2-fixing enzyme, d-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), to promote the carboxylase reaction and suppress the oxygenase reaction. In cyanobacteria and some proteobacteria, this is achieved by encapsulation of RubisCO within carboxysomes, which are examples of a group of proteinaceous bodies called bacterial microcompartments. Carboxysomes encapsulate the CO2-fixing enzyme within the selectively permeable protein shell and simultaneously encapsulate a carbonic anhydrase enzyme for CO2 supply from a cytoplasmic bicarbonate pool. These bodies appear to have arisen twice and undergone a process of convergent evolution. While the gross structures of all known carboxysomes are ostensibly very similar, with shared gross features such as a selectively permeable shell layer, each type of carboxysome encapsulates a phyletically distinct form of RubisCO enzyme. Furthermore, the specific proteins forming structures such as the protein shell or the inner RubisCO matrix are not identical between carboxysome types. Each type has evolutionarily distinct forms of the same proteins, as well as proteins that are entirely unrelated to one another. In light of recent developments in the study of carboxysome structure and function, we present this review to summarize the knowledge of the structure and function of both types of carboxysome. We also endeavor to cast light on differing evolutionary trajectories which may have led to the differences observed in extant carboxysomes.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacterial CO(2)-fixation is supported by a CO(2)-concentrating mechanism which improves photosynthesis by saturating the primary carboxylating enzyme, ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), with its preferred substrate CO(2). The site of CO(2)-concentration is a protein bound micro-compartment called the carboxysome which contains most, if not all, of the cellular RuBisCO. The shell of β-type carboxysomes is thought to be composed of two functional layers, with the inner layer involved in RuBisCO scaffolding and bicarbonate dehydration, and the outer layer in selective permeability to dissolved solutes. Here, four genes (ccmK2-4, ccmO), whose products were predicted to function in the outer shell layer of β-carboxysomes from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, were investigated by analysis of defined genetic mutants. Deletion of the ccmK2 and ccmO genes resulted in severe high-CO(2)-requiring mutants with aberrant carboxysomes, whilst deletion of ccmK3 or ccmK4 resulted in cells with wild-type physiology and normal ultrastructure. However, a tandem deletion of ccmK3-4 resulted in cells with wild-type carboxysome structure, but physiologically deficient at low CO(2) conditions. These results revealed the minimum structural determinants of the outer shell of β-carboxysomes from this strain: CcmK2, CcmO and CcmL. An accessory set of proteins was required to refine the function of the pre-existing shell: CcmK3 and CcmK4. These data suggested a model for the facet structure of β-carboxysomes with CcmL forming the vertices, CcmK2 forming the bulk facet, and CcmO, a "zipper protein," interfacing the edges of carboxysome facets.},

Their reactions to these changes require a series of rapid adaptive responses. Although transcriptional regulation is of primary importance in these responses, translational regulation and even activation of 'silenced' enzymes are critical for survival in changing environments. Bacteria have developed a series of mechanisms at the membrane structure level to cope with high concentrations of solvents. In addition, solvent-tolerant strains express highly effective efflux pumps to remove solvents from the cytoplasm. Desiccation tolerance is based on the synthesis and accumulation of osmoprotectants together with changes in fatty acid composition to preserve membrane structure. Both cold shock and heat shock responses are mainly regulated at a post-transcriptional level, translation efficiency in the case of cold shock and mRNA half-life and σ32stability in the case of heat shock.},

  abstract = {A variety of contemporary techniques were used to investigate the vertical distribution of thermophilic unicellular cyanobacteria, Synechococcus spp., and their activity within the upper 1-mm-thick photic zone of the mat community found in an alkaline siliceous hot spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Detailed measurements were made over a diel cycle at a 61 degrees C site. Net oxygenic photosynthesis measured with oxygen microelectrodes was highest within the uppermost 100- to 200-microm-thick layer until midmorning, but as the day progressed, the peak of net activity shifted to deeper layers, stabilizing at a depth of 300 microm from midday throughout the afternoon. Examination of vertical thin sections by bright-field and autofluorescence microscopy revealed the existence of different populations of Synechococcus which form discrete bands at different vertical positions. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene segments from horizontal cryosections obtained at 100-microm-thick vertical intervals also suggested vertical stratification of cyanobacterial, green sulfur bacterium-like, and green nonsulfur bacterium-like populations. There was no evidence of diel migration. However, image analysis of vertical thin sections revealed the presence of a narrow band of rod-shaped Synechococcus cells in which the cells assumed an upright position. These upright cells, located 400 to 800 microm below the surface, were observed only in mat samples obtained around noon. In mat samples obtained at other time points, the cells were randomly oriented throughout the mat. These combined observations reveal the existence of a highly ordered structure within the very thin photic zone of this hot spring microbial mat, consisting of morphologically similar Synechococcus populations that are likely to be differentially adapted, some co-occurring with green sulfur bacterium-like populations, and all overlying green nonsulfur bacterium-like populations.},

The aerogels of different densities were obtained by varying the molar ratio of MeOH/MTMS (S) from 14 to 35, with lower densities for larger S values. It has been observed that the Young's modulus (Y) decreased from 14.11 x 10(4) to 3.43 x 10(4) N/m(2) with the decrease in the density of the aerogels from 100 to 40 kg/m(3). Simultaneously, the aerogels are superhydrophobic with a contact angle as high as 164 degrees . The superhydrophobic aerogels are thermally stable up to a temperature of 530 K, above which they become hydrophilic. The aerogels have been characterized by bulk density, percentage volume shrinkage, and porosity measurements. The microstructures of the aerogels have been studied using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The Young's modulus of the aerogels has been determined by an uniaxial compression test. The variation of physical properties of the aerogels has been explained by taking into consideration the hydrolysis, condensation reactions, the resulting colloidal clusters and their network formation.},

StageTips are ordinary pipette tips containing very small disks made of beads with reversed phase, cation-exchange or anion-exchange surfaces embedded in a Teflon mesh. The fixed nature of the beads allows flexible combination of disks with different surfaces to obtain multi-functional tips. Disks containing different surface functionalities and loose beads such as titania and zirconia for phosphopeptide enrichment can be combined. Incorporation into an automated workflow has also been demonstrated. Desalting and concentration takes approximately 5 min while fractionation or enrichment takes approximately 30 min.},

Using in situ cryo-electron tomography to image the three-dimensional architecture of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, we observed that the tips of multiple thylakoids merge to form a substructure called the ‘convergence membrane’. This high-curvature membrane comes into close contact with the plasma membrane at discrete sites. We generated subtomogram averages of 70S ribosomes and array-forming phycobilisomes, then mapped these structures onto the native membrane architecture as markers for protein synthesis and photosynthesis, respectively. This molecular localization identified two distinct biogenic regions in the thylakoid network: thylakoids facing the cytosolic interior of the cell that were associated with both marker complexes, and convergence membranes that were decorated by ribosomes but not phycobilisomes. We propose that the convergence membranes perform a specialized biogenic function, coupling the synthesis of thylakoid proteins with the integration of cofactors from the plasma membrane and the periplasmic space.},

  abstract = {Since its inception just over a half century ago, the field of biomaterials has seen a consistent growth with a steady introduction of new ideas and productive branches. This review describes where we have been, the state of the art today, and where we might be in 10 or 20 years. Herein, we highlight some of the latest advancements in biomaterials that aim to control biological responses and ultimately heal. This new generation of biomaterials includes surface modification of materials to overcome nonspecific protein adsorption in vivo, precision immobilization of signaling groups on surfaces, development of synthetic materials with controlled properties for drug and cell carriers, biologically inspired materials that mimic natural processes, and design of sophisticated three-dimensional (3-D) architectures to produce well-defined patterns for diagnostics, e.g., biological microelectromechanical systems (bioMEMs), and tissue engineering.},

The current study describes the use of this technology with recombinant E. coli cells expressing the atrazine-dechlorinating enzyme AtzA in a silica/polymer porous gel. This novel recombinant enzyme-based method utilizes both adsorption and degradation to remove atrazine from water. A combination of silica nanoparticles (Ludox TM40), alkoxides, and an organic polymer was used to synthesize a porous gel. Gel curing temperatures of 23 or 45 °C were used either to maintain cell viability or to render the cells non-viable, respectively. The enzymatic activity of the encapsulated viable and non-viable cells was high and extremely stable over the time period analyzed. At room temperature, the encapsulated non-viable cells maintained a specific activity between (0.44 ± 0.06) μmol/g/min and (0.66 ± 0.12) μmol/g/min for up to 4 months, comparing well with free, viable cell-specific activities (0.61 ± 0.04 μmol/g/min). Gels cured at 45 °C had excellent structural rigidity and contained few viable cells, making these gels potentially compatible with water treatment facility applications. When encapsulated, non-viable cells were assayed at 4 °C, the activity increased threefold over free cells, potentially due to differences in lipid membranes as shown by FTIR spectroscopy and electron microscopy.},

Complete, working Mat- lab codes for each scheme are presented. The results of running the codes on ner (one-dimensional) meshes, and with smaller time steps is demonstrated. These sample calculations show that the schemes real- ize theoretical predictions of how their truncation errors depend on mesh spacing and time step. The Matlab codes are straightforward and al- low the reader to see the di erences in implementation between explicit method (FTCS) and implicit methods (BTCS and Crank-Nicolson). The codes also allow the reader to experiment with the stability limit of the FTCS scheme.},

  abstract = {The commercial application of lipases as biocatalysts for organic synthesis requires simple but efficient methods to immobilize the enzyme, yielding highly stable and active biocatalysts which are easy to recover. In this study, we present a novel method to achieve lipase immobilization by entrapment in chemically inert hydrophobic silica gels which are prepared by hydrolysis of alkyl-substituted silanes in the presence of the enzyme. A typical immobilization procedure uses: an aqueous solution of lipase; sodium fluoride as a catalyst; and additives like polyvinyl alcohol or proteins and alkoxysilane derivatives like RSi-(OMe)(3) with R = alkyl, aryl, or alkoxy as gel precursors. The effect of various immobilization parameters like stoichiometric ratio of water, silane, type and amount of additive, type and amount of catalyst, and type of silane has been carefully studied. The new method is applicable for a wide variety of lipases, yielding immobilized lipases with esterification activities enhanced by a factor of up to 88, compared to the commercial enzyme powders under identical conditions. Studies on the stability of sol-gel immobilized lipases under reaction conditions or storage (dry, in aqueous or organic medium) revealed an excellent retention of enzymatic activity. The possible reasons for the increased enzyme activities are discussed.},

  abstract = {Enzymes as catalysts in synthetic organic chemistry gained importance in the latter half of the 20th century, but nevertheless suffered from two major limitations. First, many enzymes were not accessible in large enough quantities for practical applications. The advent of recombinant DNA technology changed this dramatically in the late 1970s. Second, many enzymes showed a narrow substrate scope, often poor stereo- and/or regioselectivity and/or insufficient stability under operating conditions. With the development of directed evolution beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, all of these problems can be addressed and generally solved. The present Perspective focuses on these and other developments which have popularized enzymes as part of the toolkit of synthetic organic chemists and biotechnologists. Included is a discussion of the scope and limitation of cascade reactions using enzyme mixtures in vitro and of metabolic engineering of pathways in cells as factories for the production of simple compounds such as biofuels and complex natural products. Future trends and problems are also highlighted, as is the discussion concerning biocatalysis versus nonbiological catalysis in synthetic organic chemistry. This Perspective does not constitute a comprehensive review, and therefore the author apologizes to those researchers whose work is not specifically treated here.},

TPPBs are comprised of an aqueous, cell containing phase, and an immiscible, biocompatible organic phase that partitions toxic and/or poorly soluble substrates (in this case biphenyl) based on maintaining a thermodynamic equilibrium. The critical LogKO/W of the organism was found to be approximately 5.5, indicating that solvents with a LogKO/W larger than 5.5 are suitable as delivery phases for B. xenovorans LB400. Two solvents selected for the TPPB system were octadecene and bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (BES). In one experiment a total of 6.6 g biphenyl per l aqueous-phase-equivalent (biphenyl delivered in solvent, at an aqueous phase to solvent ratio of 10) could be degraded in 25 h during batch operation with octadecene. The specific growth rate and the half saturation constant of the Monod model were estimated to be mumax=0.25 h-1 and KS=0.0001 g l-1, and the yield coefficient was YX/S=0.48 g biomass per g biphenyl. These parameter estimates were used to predict the time course of biphenyl degradation at different initial substrate concentrations and with biphenyl delivered from the two solvents with different partitioning behaviour for biphenyl. The predictions were validated by experimental data, confirming the microbial kinetics as well as the expected partitioning effects.},

In this study, a novel thermolysis method was used to disrupt E. coli cells to release a recombinant thermostable esterase. We found that heat treatment of E. coli was highly effective to destroy the integrity of bacterial cell walls and release the recombinant hyperthermophilic esterase at temperatures above 60 °C. The effects of temperature, pH and cell concentration on the efficiency of cell disruption were examined. The most effective temperature for cell disruption was at 80 °C. The pH and cell concentration had only minor effect on the release of the hyperthermophilic esterase. In addition, we found that the hyperthermophilic esterase could be purified at the early stage of the thermolysis, which is a major advantage of the thermolysis method. Finally, a comparison between thermolysis and traditional methods for the disruption of cells and the release of the thermostable enzyme was made. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Salicylate-induced cells of Pseudomonas sp. strain 9816/11 and isopropyl-beta-o-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells of Escherichia coli JM109(DE3)(pDTG141) oxidized fluorene to (+)-(3S,JR)-cis-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrofluorene (80 to 90\% relative yield; {$>$}95\% enantiomeric excess [ee]) and 9-fluorenol ({$<$}10\% yield).

The major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase with each substrate was stereospecific dihydroxylation in which the cis-dihydrodiols were of identical regiochemistry and of R configuration at the benzylic center adjacent to the bridgehead carbon atom, The regiospecific oxidation of dibenzofuran differed from that of the other substrates in that a significant amount of the minor cis-3,4-dihydrodiol regioisomer was formed. The results indicate that although the absolute stereochemistry of the cis-diene diols was the same, the nature of the bridging atom or heteroatom influenced the regiospecificity of the reactions catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase.},

As a result of Tn5's early discovery and its simple macromolecular requirements for transposition, the Tn5 system has been a very productive tool for studying the molecular mechanism of DNA transposition. These studies are of broad value because they offer insights into DNA transposition in general, because DNA transposition is a useful model with which to understand other types of protein-DNA interactions such as retroviral DNA integration and the DNA cleavage events involved in immunoglobulin gene formation, and because Tn5-derived tools are useful adjuncts in genetic experimentation.

Observing these phenomena has generally required conditions far removed from physiological stresses. We show that poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1 in yeast), a defining marker of stress granules, phase separates and forms hydrogels in~vitro upon exposure to physiological stress conditions. Other RNA-binding proteins depend upon low-complexity regions (LCRs) or RNA for phase separation, whereas Pab1’s LCR is not required for demixing, and RNA inhibits it. Based on unique evolutionary patterns, we create LCR mutations, which systematically tune its biophysical properties and Pab1 phase separation in~vitro and in~vivo. Mutations that impede phase separation reduce organism fitness during prolonged stress. Poly(A)-binding protein thus acts as a physiological stress sensor, exploiting phase separation to precisely mark stress onset, a broadly generalizable mechanism.},

Combinations of the models for mixtures of basic porosity types and changes in basic model parameters (e.g. stacking) over the significant porosity range covered, are shown to agree with the literature (mainly mechanical) property data for bodies of appropriate porosity combinations.

These advances promise to unlock an exciting array of 'smart' bacteria for clinical use but will also challenge scientists to better optimize preclinical testing regimes for early identification and validation of promising strains and strategies. Here, we review recent advances in the development and testing of engineered bacterial diagnostics and therapeutics.

Priming is the improved reaction of an organism to an environmental stressor following a preceding, often milder stress event. This phenomenon, also known as cross-protection, predictive response strategy or acquired stress resistance, is becoming an increasingly well-established research topic in microbiology, which has so far been examined from the perspective of a single organism or population. However, microbes in nature occur as part of communities; thus it is timely to highlight the need to also include this level beyond the individual species in studies of priming effects. We here introduce a conceptual framework for such studies at the level of the microbial assemblage and also chart a way forward for empirical and theoretical study. We illustrate some of the elements of our framework with a simple simulation model. Given the dynamic habitat of many microbes, incorporating priming is important for a more complete understanding of microbial community responses to stress.},

In this context, the validity of the Sauerbrey equation (change in resonance frequency α change in applied mass) is discussed. The Sauerbrey equation gives an accurate estimate of the film thickness, tf, only if (i) the film is thin compared to the shear-wave penetration depth, δ, into the liquid, i.e., tf ⪡ δ, and (ii) the film does not slide on the QCM electrode (s). We have shown that by measuring both the QCM resonance frequency and the dissipation factor simultaneously, the thickness range over which tf can be measured accurately can be extended to about 2δ for non-slipping films. If the film slips, which we have only observed for molecularly thin films, changes in dissipation factor can be used to calculate the coefficient of friction between the film and the substrate. We also show the usefulness of measuring the dissipation factor of the QCM when studying solid to liquid phase transitions.},

The technical solution allows operation in vacuum, air, or liquid. The crystal is driven at its resonant frequency by an oscillator that can be intermittently disconnected causing the crystal oscillation amplitude to decay exponentially. From the recorded decay curve the absolute Q factor (calculated from the decay time constant), the frequency of the freely oscillating crystal, and the amplitude of oscillation are obtained. All measurements are fully automated. One electrode of the QCM in our setup was connected to true ground which makes possible simultaneous electrochemistry. The performance is illustrated by experiments in fluids of varying viscosity (gas and liquid) and by protein adsorption in situ. We found, in addition to the above results, that the amplitude of oscillation is not always directly proportional to the Q factor, as the commonly used theory states. This puts limitations on the customary use of the amplitude of oscillation as a measure of the Q factor. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

For example, they may be related to the stabilization of a hyperactivated form of the enzyme, like in the case of lipases immobilized on hydrophobic supports via interfacial activation. In some other instances, these improvements will be just a consequence of random modifications in the enzyme properties that in some reactions will be positive while in others may be negative. For this reason, the preparation of a library of biocatalysts as broad as possible may be a key turning point to find an immobilized biocatalyst with improved properties when compared to the free enzyme. Immobilized enzymes will be dispersed on the support surface and aggregation will no longer be possible, while the free enzyme may suffer aggregation, which greatly decreases enzyme activity. Moreover, enzyme rigidification may lead to preservation of the enzyme properties under drastic conditions in which the enzyme tends to become distorted thus decreasing its activity. Furthermore, immobilization of enzymes on a support, mainly on a porous support, may in many cases also have a positive impact on the observed enzyme behavior, not really related to structural changes. For example, the promotion of diffusional problems (e.g., pH gradients, substrate or product gradients), partition (towards or away from the enzyme environment, for substrate or products), or the blocking of some areas (e.g., reducing inhibitions) may greatly improve enzyme performance. Thus, in this tutorial review, we will try to list and explain some of the main reasons that may produce an improvement in enzyme activity, specificity or selectivity, either real or apparent, due to immobilization.},

These structures differ from the sphere-like silica network of particles obtained in vitro under static conditions. Under chemical influences, overall morphologies were observed to shift from a characteristic network of sphere-like silica particles to a sheetlike structure in the presence of -OH groups from additives and to sharp-edged, platelike structures in the presence of larger polycationic peptide matrixes. Under physical influences, using externally applied force fields, overall silica morphologies were observed to transition from sphere-like to fiberlike and dendrite-like structures. These findings could lead to the future development of bio-inspired complex 2-D and 3-D silica micro- and nano-devices.},

  abstract = {Engineering cells to produce valuable metabolic products is hindered by the slow and laborious methods available for evaluating product concentration. Consequently, many designs go unevaluated, and the dynamics of product formation over time go unobserved. In this work, we develop a framework for observing product formation in real time without the need for sample preparation or laborious analytical methods. We use genetically encoded biosensors derived from small-molecule responsive transcription factors to provide a fluorescent readout that is proportional to the intracellular concen-tration of a target metabolite. Combining an appropriate biosensor with cells designed to produce a metabolic product allows us to track product formation by observing fluorescence. With individual cells exhibiting fluorescent intensities proportional to the amount of metabolite they produce, high-throughput methods can be used to rank the quality of genetic variants or production conditions. We observe production of several renewable plastic precursors with fluorescent readouts and demonstrate that higher fluorescence is indeed an indicator of higher product titer. Using fluorescence as a guide, we identify process parameters that produce 3-hydroxypro-pionate at 4.2 g/L, 23-fold higher than previously reported. We also report, to our knowledge, the first engineered route from glucose to acrylate, a plastic precursor with global sales of \$14 billion. Finally, we monitor the production of glucarate, a replacement for environ-mentally damaging detergents, and muconate, a renewable pre-cursor to polyethylene terephthalate and nylon with combined markets of \$51 billion, in real time, demonstrating that our method is applicable to a wide range of molecules. biotechnology | directed evolution | biosensor | metabolic engineering | synthetic biology},

  abstract = {Two proteins found in cyanobacteria contain a C-terminal domain with homology to the small subunit of rubisco (RbcS). These small subunit-like domains (SSLDs) are important features of CcmM, a protein involved in the biogenesis of carboxysomes found in all β-cyanobacteria, and a rubisco activase homolog [activase-like protein of cyanobacteria (ALC)] found in over a third of sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. Interaction with rubisco is crucial to the function of CcmM and is believed to be important to ALC as well. In both cases, the SSLD aggregates rubisco, and this nucleation event may be important in regulating rubisco assembly and activity. Recently, two independent studies supported the conclusion that the SSLD of CcmM binds equatorially to L8S8 holoenzymes of rubisco rather than by displacing an RbcS, as its structural homology would suggest. We use sequence analysis and homology modeling to examine whether the SSLD from the ALC could bind the large subunit of rubisco either via an equatorial interaction or in an RbcS site, if available. We suggest that the SSLD from the ALC of Fremyella diplosiphon could bind either in a vacant RbcS site or equatorially. Our homology modeling takes into account N-terminal residues not represented in available cryo-electron microscopy structures that potentially contribute to the interface between the large subunit of rubisco (RbcL) and RbcS. Here, we suggest the perspective that binding site variability as a means of regulation is plausible and that the dynamic interaction between the RbcL, RbcS, and SSLDs may be important for carboxysome assembly and function.},

  abstract = {The XPS (ESCA) method was employed to quantitatively determine polyelectrolyte adsorption on the mica basal plane from low ionic strength solutions. Particular emphasis was given to the effect of the polyelectrolyte charge density. By combining the results obtained from XPS and surface force measurements it was possible to analyze the cation exchange at the surface that occurs as a result of polyelectrolyte adsorption. AFM-imaging was used to obtain information on the structure of the adsorbed layer when the polyelectrolyte coverage was low. Further, the desorption of preadsorbed polyelectrolyte layers by addition of inorganic salt and by addition of an anionic surfactant was investigated by XPS and some complementary surface force measurements. The results demonstrate that the lower the polyelectrolyte charge density is, the easier it is to remove the polyelectrolyte from the surface. The surfactant, which by itself does not adsorb to the mica surface, is more efficient in this respect than the inorganic salt. This observation can be rationalized by considering that the surfactant and polyelectrolyte form complexes with each other. Thus, the surfactant brings negative charges into the adsorbed layer that reduces the affinity to the surface. However, high-charge-density polyelectrolytes are removed to a very limited degree even when the surfactant concentration is above the critical micellar concentration, which is explainable by the poor solubility of the polyelectrolyte?surfactant complexes formed.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

However, spatial information is usually overlooked by downstream data analyses, which usually consider single-cell read-out values as independent measurements for further averaging or clustering, thus disregarding spatial locations. With this work, we attempt to fill this gap. We developed a toolbox that allows one to test for the presence of a spatial effect in microscopy images of adherent cells and estimate the spatial scale of this effect. The proposed Python module can be used for any light microscopy images of cells as well as other types of single-cell data such as in situ transcriptomics or metabolomics. The input format of our package matches standard output formats from image analysis tools such as CellProfiler, Fiji, or Icy and thus makes our toolbox easy and straightforward to use, yet offering a powerful statistical approach for a wide range of applications. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

Models were developed accounting for reactions including the simulation of experiments with sequential pulsing of two gases in order to study the reaction of adsorbed and gaseous species.

Symbiodinium convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into organic carbon and oxygen to fuel coral growth and calcification, creating habitat for these diverse and productive ecosystems. Light is thus a key regulating factor shaping the productivity, physiology, and ecology of the coral holobiont. Similar to all oxygenic photoautotrophs, Symbiodinium must safely harvest sunlight for photosynthesis and dissipate excess energy to prevent oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is caused by environmental stressors such as those associated with global climate change, and ultimately leads to breakdown of the coral-algal symbiosis known as coral bleaching. Recently, large-scale coral bleaching events have become pervasive and frequent threatening and endangering coral reefs. Because the coral-algal symbiosis is the biological engine producing the reef, the future of coral reef ecosystems depends on the ecophysiology of the symbiosis. This review examines the photobiology of the coral-algal symbiosis with particular focus on the photophysiological responses and timescales of corals and Symbiodinium. Additionally, this review summarizes the light environment and its dynamics, the vulnerability of the symbiosis to oxidative stress, the abiotic and biotic factors influencing photosynthesis, the diversity of the coral-algal symbiosis, and recent advances in the field. Studies integrating physiology with the developing "omics" fields will provide new insights into the coral-algal symbiosis. Greater physiological and ecological understanding of the coral-algal symbiosis is needed for protection and conservation of coral reefs.},

Here we describe a different mechanism for microcompartment assembly, one that is fundamentally nonequilibrium and yet highly reliable. This pathway is revealed by simulations of a molecular model resolving the size and shape of a cargo droplet and the extent and topography of an elastic shell. The resulting metastable microcompartment structures closely resemble those of carboxysomes, with a narrow size distribution and faceted shells. The essence of their assembly dynamics can be understood from a simpler mathematical model that combines elements of classical nucleation theory with continuum elasticity. These results highlight important control variables for achieving nanoscale encapsulation in general and for modulating the size and shape of carboxysomes in particular.},

Also, some critical aspects dealing with the sample mass, the sample temperature and the adsorption equilibrium are examined. The importance of a careful outgassing for obtaining a reproducible state is stressed and the procedures available to reach this goal are detailed. In addition, this chapter contains a practical introduction to gas adsorption calorimetry and to its most important aspects in the study of physisorption.

The adsorbent behaviour of each type of oxide is examined, with special attention to particular features which easily lend themselves to misinterpretation: composite isotherms, non-rigid porous structures resulting from partial disaggregation of grains or from platy crystals, specific interaction between the N2 molecule and polar sites of the surface (hydroxyls, cations, defects). The major influence of the thermal treatment on the adsorbent properties and the interest of well-controlled procedures is also stressed and illustrated. The chapter ends with a brief review of the numerous applications of mineral oxides as adsorbents.},

  abstract = {Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is a model organism used for studying photosynthesis and the circadian clock, and it is being developed for the production of fuel, industrial chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. To identify a comprehensive set of genes and intergenic regions that impacts fitness in S. elongatus, we created a pooled library of ∼250,000 transposon mutants and used sequencing to identify the insertion locations. By analyzing the distribution and survival of these mutants, we identified 718 of the organism's 2,723 genes as essential for survival under laboratory conditions. The validity of the essential gene set is supported by its tight overlap with well-conserved genes and its enrichment for core biological processes. The differences noted between our dataset and these predictors of essentiality, however, have led to surprising biological insights. One such finding is that genes in a large portion of the TCA cycle are dispensable, suggesting that S. elongatus does not require a cyclic TCA process. Furthermore, the density of the transposon mutant library enabled individual and global statements about the essentiality of noncoding RNAs, regulatory elements, and other intergenic regions. In this way, a group I intron located in tRNA(Leu), which has been used extensively for phylogenetic studies, was shown here to be essential for the survival of S. elongatus. Our survey of essentiality for every locus in the S. elongatus genome serves as a powerful resource for understanding the organism's physiology and defines the essential gene set required for the growth of a photosynthetic organism.},

FtsA and ZipA localized into a division ring following the same pattern and time course as FtsZ. The concentration (amount relative to total mass) of the three proteins remained constant during one complete cell cycle, showing that assembly of a division ring is not driven by changes in the concentration of these proteins.

  abstract = {Background: ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Results: We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase, engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This next-generation ImageJ, called "ImageJ2" in places where the distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. Conclusions: Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The described improvements provide a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.},

There is growing evidence that the channel capacity of cellular pathways is limited to a few bits, questioning whether cells quantify external stimuli or rely on threshold detection and binary on/off decisions. Here, using fluorescence microscopy and information theory, we analyzed the ability of the transcriptional regulator TetR to sense and quantify the antibiotic tetracycline. The results showed that noise filtering by negative feedback increased information transmission up to 2 bits, generating a graded response able to discriminate different antibiotic concentrations. This response matched the antibiotic subinhibitory selection window, suggesting that information transmission through TetR is optimized to quantify sublethal antibiotic levels. Noise filtering by negative feedback may thus boost the discriminative power of cellular sensors, enabling signal quantification.},

  abstract = {Carboxysomes are compartments in bacterial cells that promote efficient carbon fixation by sequestering RubisCO and carbonic anhydrase within a protein shell that impedes CO2 escape. The key to assembling this protein complex is CcmM, a multidomain protein whose C-terminal region is required for RubisCO recruitment. This CcmM region is built as a series of copies (generally 3–5) of a small domain, CcmMS, joined by unstructured linkers. CcmMS domains have weak, but significant, sequence identity to RubisCO’s small subunit, RbcS, suggesting that CcmM binds RubisCO by displacing RbcS. We report here the 1.35-Å structure of the first Thermosynechococcus elongatus CcmMS domain, revealing that it adopts a compact, well-defined structure that resembles that of RbcS. CcmMS, however, lacked key RbcS RubisCO-binding determinants, most notably an extended N-terminal loop. Nevertheless, individual CcmMS domains are able to bind RubisCO in vitro with 1.16 M affinity. Two or four linked CcmMS domains did not exhibit dramatic increases in this affinity, implying that short, disordered linkers may frustrate successive CcmMS domains attempting to simultaneously bind a single RubisCO oligomer. Size-exclusion chromatography– coupled right-angled light scattering (SEC-RALS) and native MS experiments indicated that multiple CcmMS domains can bind a single RubisCO holoenzyme and, moreover, that RbcS is not released from these complexes. CcmMS bound equally tightly to a RubisCO variant in which the / domain of RbcS was deleted, suggesting that CcmMS binds RubisCO independently of its RbcS subunit. We propose that, instead, the electropositive CcmMS may bind to an extended electronegative pocket between RbcL dimers.},

  abstract = {Sucrose is an industrially important carbon source for microbial fermentation. Sucrose utilization in Escherichia coli, however, is poorly understood, and most industrial strains cannot utilize sucrose. The roles of the chromosomally encoded sucrose catabolism (csc) genes in E. coliWwere examined by knockout and overexpression experiments. At low sucrose concentrations, the csc genes are repressed and cells cannot grow. Removal of either the repressor protein (cscR) or the fructokinase (cscK) gene facilitated derepression. Furthermore, combinatorial knockout of cscR and cscK conferred an improved growth rate on low sucrose. The invertase (cscA) and sucrose transporter (cscB) genes are essential for sucrose catabolism in E. coli W, demonstrating that no other genes can provide sucrose transport or inversion activities. However, cscK is not essential for sucrose utilization. Fructose is excreted into the medium by the cscK-knockout strain in the presence of high sucrose, whereas at low sucrose (when carbon availability is limiting), fructose is utilized by the cell. Overexpression of cscA, cscAK, or cscAB could complement the WδcscRKAB knockout mutant or confer growth on a K-12 strain which could not naturally utilize sucrose. However, phenotypic stability and relatively good growth rates were observed in the K-12 strain only when overexpressing cscAB, and full growth rate complementation inWδcscRKAB also required cscAB. Our understanding of sucrose utilization can be used to improve E. coliWand engineer sucrose utilization in strains which do not naturally utilize sucrose, allowing substitution of sucrose for other, less desirable carbon sources in industrial fermentations. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

Whether these cells are in a state of dormancy or in a stage preceding cell death has been considered of paramount importance for the past couple of decades. In this study, osmotic-stress-induced dormant bacterial cells were separated by cell sorting and revived by osmotic down-shift in the absence of nutrients, source(s) that potentially could supply nutrients, and/or the external addition of resuscitation factor(s). Reversal of dormancy followed a definite pattern akin to population asynchrony of dormant cells, and the phenomenon was observed across three species, namely, Enterobacter sp. strain mcp11b, Klebsiella pneumonia strain mcp11d and Escherichia coli. In addition, our study precisely forecasted the presence of multiple subpopulations in dormant cells, which is explained by an emerging theory of survival mechanisms in stressful environments. These observations reveal that the state of dormancy induced by environmental stress in these nonspore-forming bacteria is "reversible" and also implies that it is an orderly and spontaneous adaptation to circumvent adverse conditions.},

In order to utilize these unique biocatalytic functionalities in the context of industrially relevant processes, bioencapsulation materials with high mechanical strength are required. Herein, we report the development of silica gels for bioremediation based on varying ratios of silicon alkoxide and silica nanoparticles.

  abstract = {A computational framework combining Agent-Based Models (ABMs) and Deep Learning techniques was developed to help design microbial communities that convert light and CO2 into useful bioproducts. An ABM that accounts for CO2, light, sucrose export rate and cell-to-cell mechanical interactions was used to investigate the growth of an engineered sucrose-exporting strain of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The ABM simulations produced population curves and synthetic images of colony growth. The curves and the images were analyzed, and growth was correlated to nutrients availability and colonies’ initial spatial distribution. To speed up the ABM simulations, a metamodel based on a Recurrent Neural Network, RNN, was trained on the synthetic images of growth. This metamodel successfully reproduced the population curves and the images of growth at a lower computational cost.

Specifically, they include explicit formulation of Gibbs energies and metabolite concentrations, which enables straightforward integration of metabolite concentration measurements. Motivation High-throughput analytic technologies provide a wealth of omics data that can be used to perform thorough analyses for a multitude of studies in the areas of Systems Biology and Biotechnology. Nevertheless, most studies are still limited to constraint-based Flux Balance Analyses (FBA), neglecting an important physicochemical constraint: Thermodynamics. Thermodynamics-based Flux Analysis (TFA) in metabolic models enables the integration of quantitative metabolomics data to study their effects on the net-flux directionality of reactions in the network. In addition, it allows us to estimate how far each reaction operates from thermodynamic equilibrium, which provides critical information for guiding metabolic engineering decisions. Results We present a Python package (pyTFA) and a Matlab toolbox (matTFA) that implement TFA. We show an example of application on both a reduced and a genome-scale model of E. coli., and demonstrate TFA and data integration through TFA reduce the feasible flux space with respect to FBA. Availability and implementation Documented implementation of TFA framework both in Python (pyTFA) and Matlab (matTFA) are available on www.github.com/EPFL-LCSB/.},

The preparation of the hydrogels involved the conventional melting of agarose in water followed by addition of APTS as functional group carrier. The resulting hydrogel supports have been studied by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy in order to get an insight into the hybrid molecular structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been used for the analysis of the surface chemical composition of the hydrogels. It is deduced from these data that the resulting hybrid structure presents two phases with a clear tendency toward APTS surface segregation. Moreover, the observation of the desiccated hydrogel surfaces by atomic force microscopy shows that the films acquire a filament-mesh structure for increasing APTS content, while the pure agarose supports exhibit a granular structure. As a result of such a structure, the hydrogel surfaces show a hydrophobic behavior, as determined by water contact angle measurements. The biocompatibility of such platforms is supported by adhesion-proliferation assays performed with hMSCs. It is concluded that although adhesion is lower on APTS rich scaffolds, the proliferation rate on these surfaces is higher so that total number of proliferating cells does not significantly depend on APTS content in the hydrogels.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria must prevent imbalances between absorbed light energy (source) and the metabolic capacity (sink) to utilize it to protect their photosynthetic apparatus against damage. A number of photoprotective mechanisms assist in dissipating excess absorbed energy, including respiratory terminal oxidases and flavodiiron proteins, but inherently reduce photosynthetic efficiency. Recently, it has been hypothesized that some engineered metabolic pathways may improve photosynthetic performance by correcting source/sink imbalances. In the context of this subject, we explored the interconnectivity between endogenous electron valves, and the activation of one or more heterologous metabolic sinks. We coexpressed two heterologous metabolic pathways that have been previously shown to positively impact photosynthetic activity in cyanobacteria, a sucrose production pathway (consum-ing ATP and reductant) and a reductant-only consuming cyto-chrome P450. Sucrose export was associated with improved quantum yield of phtotosystem II (PSII) and enhanced electron transport chain flux, especially at lower illumination levels, while cytochrome P450 activity led to photosynthetic enhancements primarily observed under high light. Moreover, coexpression of these two heterologous sinks showed additive impacts on photosynthe-sis, indicating that neither sink alone was capable of utilizing the full "overcapacity" of the electron transport chain. We find that heterologous sinks may partially compensate for the loss of pho-tosystem I (PSI) oxidizing mechanisms even under rapid illumination changes, although this compensation is incomplete. Our results provide support for the theory that heterologous metabolism can act as a photosynthetic sink and exhibit some overlapping functionality with photoprotective mechanisms, while potentially conserving energy within useful metabolic products that might otherwise be "lost." cyanobacteria | photosynthesis | photoprotection | photoproduction | metabolic engineering C yanobacteria, equipped with photosynthetic machinery to fix CO 2 into reduced forms, have been increasingly engineered as biotechnological platforms for light-driven production of a wide variety of bioproducts (1). However, although the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar-to-biomass energy conversion in cyanobacteria has been estimated as 8 to 10\%, the best sustained efficiencies that have been reported are in the range of 1 to 2\% (2). A major loss to photosynthetic efficiency occurs when source energies (absorbed solar radiation) exceed the capacity of sink metabolism (total cellular energy demand), resulting in increased activation of dissipative photoprotection mechanisms (3). Balancing source/sink energies is one strategy for improving photosynthetic efficiency, and this has typically been pursued by dampening the light energy that is absorbed by cyanobacteria (2, 4), though it has been hypothesized more recently that enhancing sink capacity through rewiring downstream metabolism may achieve similar effects (5). Cyanobacterial alternative electron transport pathways that accept electrons in the electron transport chain (ETC) and cat-alyze the reduction of O 2 to water to avoid the uncontrolled formation of damaging reactive oxygen species, include fla-vodiiron proteins (FDPs) and respiratory terminal oxidases (RTOs) (Fig. 1) (6, 7). Electron flux to RTO and FDP pathways still contribute to proton motive force formation; FDP water-water cycle activity is located downstream of proton-pumping complexes of the ETC (8), and cytochrome oxidase (COX) also directly pumps protons to the lumen (9) (Fig. 1). Nonetheless , by effectively short-circuiting the canonical linear flow of electrons through the ETC, the activity of FDPs and RTOs decrease photosynthetic generation of reducing equivalents (e.g., NADPH) and reduce conversion of potential energy into bio-molecules. While the mechanisms underlying the regulation of these pathways have not been elucidated, it is clear that electron flux to them can be dynamically altered on short time scales (seconds to minutes) (10). These mechanisms have been found to be important for energy homeostasis, especially in dynamic environments such as fluctuating light intensities, where they may assist in balancing the overreduction of the ETC (11-13). There is evidence that FDPs and RTOs can exhibit prolonged activity even under controlled-light laboratory conditions, potentially consuming a significant portion of electrons originating Significance Cyanobacteria have been increasingly explored as a biotechnological platform, although their economic feasibility relies in part on the capacity to maximize their photosynthetic, solar-to-biomass energy conversion efficiency. Here we show that cyanobacterial photosynthetic capacity can be increased by diverting cellular resources toward heterologous, energy-storing metabolic pathways and by reducing electron flow to photoprotective, but energy-dissipating, oxygen reduction reactions. We further show that these heterologous sinks can partially contribute to photosystem I (PSI) oxidation, suggesting an engineering strategy to improve both energy storage capacity and robustness by selective diversion of excess pho-tosynthetic capacity to productive processes.},

In recent years, the available devices and strategies for modifying cyanobacteria have been increasing, including advances in the design of genetic promoters, ribosome binding sites, riboswitches, reporter proteins, modular vector systems, and markerless selection systems. Because of these new toolkits, cyanobacteria have been successfully engineered to express heterologous pathways for the production of a wide variety of valuable compounds. Cyanobacterial strains with the potential to be used in real-world applications will require the refinement of genetic circuits used to express the heterologous pathways and development of accurate models that predict how these pathways can be best integrated into the larger cellular metabolic network. Herein, we review advances that have been made to translate synthetic biology tools into cyanobacterial model organisms and summarize experimental and in silico strategies that have been employed to increase their bioproduction potential. Despite the advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering during the last years, it is clear that still further improvements are required if cyanobacteria are to be competitive with heterotrophic microorganisms for the bioproduction of added-value compounds.},

  abstract = {Transpiration of cuticular membranes isolated from the lower stomatous surface of Hedera helix (ivy) leaves was measured using a novel approach which allowed a distinction to be made between gas phase diffusion (through stomatal pores) and solid phase diffusion (transport through the polymer matrix membrane and cuticular waxes) of water molecules. This approach is based on the principle that the diffusivity of water vapour in the gas phase can be manipulated by using different gases (helium, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide) while diffusivity of water in the solid phase is not affected. This approach allowed the flow of water across stomatal pores ('stomatal transpiration') to be calculated separately from the flow across the cuticle (cuticular transpiration) on the stomatous leaf surface. As expected, water flux across the cuticle isolated from the astomatous leaf surface was not affected by the gas composition since there are no gas-filled pores. Resistance to flux of water through the solid cuticle on the stomatous leaf surface was about 11 times lower than cuticular resistance on the astomatous leaf surface, indicating pronounced differences in barrier properties between cuticles isolated from both leaf surfaces. In order to check whether this difference in resistance was due to different barrier properties of cuticular waxes on both leaf sides, mobility of 14C-labelled 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-butyric acid 14C-2,4-DB) in reconstituted cuticular wax isolated from both leaf surfaces was measured separately. However, mobility of 14C-2,4-DB in reconstituted wax isolated from the lower leaf surface was 2.6 times lower compared with the upper leaf side. The significantly higher permeability of the ivy cuticle on the lower stomatous leaf surface compared with the astomatous surface might result from lateral heterogeneity in permeability of the cuticle covering normal epidermal cells compared with the cuticle covering the stomatal cell surface.},

These machines contain a compartmental protease, with active sites sequestered in an interior chamber, and a hexameric ring of AAA+ ATPases. Substrate proteins are tethered to the ring, either directly or via adaptor proteins. An unstructured region of the substrate is engaged in the axial pore of the AAA+ ring, and cycles of ATP binding/hydrolysis drive conformational changes that create pulses of pulling that denature the substrate and translocate the unfolded polypeptide through the pore and into the degradation chamber. Here, we review our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition, adaptor function, and ATP-fueled unfolding and translocation. The unfolding activities of these and related AAA+ machines can also be used to disassemble or remodel macromolecular complexes and to resolubilize aggregates.},

  abstract = {Selective chemical reactions enacted within a cellular environment can be powerful tools for elucidating biological processes or engineering novel interactions. A chemical transformation that permits the selective formation of covalent adducts among richly functionalized biopolymers within a cellular context is presented. A ligation modeled after the Staudinger reaction forms an amide bond by coupling of an azide and a specifically engineered triarylphosphine. Both reactive partners are abiotic and chemically orthogonal to native cellular components. Azides installed within cell surface glycoconjugates by metabolism of a synthetic azidosugar were reacted with a biotinylated triarylphosphine to produce stable cell-surface adducts. The tremendous selectivity of the transformation should permit its execution within a cell's interior, offering new possibilities for probing intracellular interactions.},

We demonstrate a 3D printing approach to create bacteria-derived functional materials by combining the natural diverse metabolism of bacteria with the shape design freedom of additive manufacturing. To achieve this, we embedded bacteria in a biocompatible and functionalized 3D printing ink and printed two types of “living materials” capable of degrading pollutants and of producing medically relevant bacterial cellulose. With this versatile bacteria-printing platform, complex materials displaying spatially specific compositions, geometry, and properties not accessed by standard technologies can be assembled from bottom up for new biotechnological and biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {The membrane lipid bilayer is one of the primary cellular components affected by variations in hydration level, which cause changes in lipid packing that may have detrimental effects on cell viability. In this study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to quantify changes in the membrane phase behavior, as identified by membrane phase transition temperature (Tm), of Escherichia coli during desiccation and rehydration. Extensive cell desiccation (1~week at 20\%-40\% RH) resulted in an increase in Tm from 8.4 ± 1.7~°C (in undried control samples) to 16.5 ± 1.3~°C. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis (FAME) on desiccated samples showed an increase in the percent composition of saturated fatty acids (FAs) and a decrease in unsaturated FAs in comparison to undried control samples. However, rehydration of E. coli resulted in a gradual regression in Tm, which began approximately 1~day after initial rehydration and plateaued at 12.5 ± 1.8~°C after approximately 2~days of rehydration. FAME analysis during progressive rehydration revealed an increase in the membrane percent composition of unsaturated FAs and a decrease in saturated FAs. Cell recovery analysis during rehydration supported the previous findings that showed that E. coli enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state during desiccation and recover following prolonged rehydration. In addition, we found that the delay period of approximately 1~day of rehydration prior to membrane reconfiguration (i.e. decrease in Tm and increase in membrane percent composition of unsaturated FAs) also preceded cell recovery. These results suggest that changes in membrane structure and state related to greater membrane fluidity may be associated with cell proliferation capabilities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ribosomal RNA molecules are widely used for phylogenetic and in situ identification of bacteria. Nevertheless, their use to distinguish microorganisms within a species is often restricted by the high degree of sequence conservation and limited probe accessibility to the target in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To overcome these limitations, we examined the use of tmRNA for in situ identification. In E. coli, this stable 363 nucleotides long RNA is encoded by the ssrA gene, which is involved in the degradation of truncated proteins. RESULTS: Conserved sequences at the 5'- and 3'-ends of tmRNA genes were used to design universal primers that could amplify the internal part of ssrA from Gram-positive bacteria having low G+C content, i.e. genera Bacillus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Sequence analysis of tmRNAs showed that this molecule can be used for phylogenetic assignment of bacteria. Compared to 16S rRNA, the tmRNA nucleotide sequences of some bacteria, for example Listeria, display considerable divergence between species. Using E. coli as an example, we have shown that bacteria can be specifically visualized by FISH with tmRNA targeted probes. CONCLUSIONS: Features of tmRNA, including its presence in phylogenetically distant bacteria, conserved regions at gene extremities and a potential to serve as target for FISH, make this molecule a possible candidate for identification of bacteria.},

  abstract = {Silicateins are the key enzymes involved in the enzymatic polycondensation of the inorganic scaffold of the skeletal elements of the siliceous sponges, the spicules. The gene encoding pro-silicatein is inserted into the pCold TF vector, comprising the gene for the bacterial trigger factor. This hybrid gene is expressed in Escherichia coli and the synthesized fusion protein is purified. The fusion protein is split into the single proteins with thrombin by cleavage of the linker sequence present between the two proteins. At 23 °C, the 87 kDa trigger factor-pro-silicatein fusion protein is cleaved to the 51 kDa trigger factor and the 35 kDa pro-silicatein. The cleavage process proceeds and results in the release of the 23 kDa mature silicatein, a process which very likely proceeds by autocatalysis. Almost in parallel with its formation, the mature enzyme precipitates as pure 23 kDa protein. When the precipitate is dissolved in an urea buffer, the solubilized protein displays its full enzymatic activity which is enhanced multi-fold in the presence of the silicatein interactor silintaphin-1 or of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The biosilica product formed increases its compactness if silicatein is supplemented with silintaphin-1 or PEG. The elastic modulus of the silicatein-mediated biosilica product increases in parallel with the addition of silintaphin-1 and/or PEG from 17 MPa (silicatein) via 61 MPa (silicatein:silintaphin-1) to 101 MPa (silicatein:silintaphin-1 and PEG). These data show that the maturation process from the pro-silicatein state to the mature form is the crucial step during which silicatein acquires its structure-guiding and structure-forming properties.},

Recent studies have revealed that the spherical unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Further functional and physiological studies highlight a very complex control of cyanobacterial phototaxis by sensory proteins, histidine kinases and response regulators. Notably, PATAN domain response regulators appear to participate in directional control of phototaxis in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In this review we explain the problem of directional light sensing at the small scale of bacteria and discuss our current understanding of signal transduction in cyanobacterial phototaxis.},

  abstract = {The work presented here shows for the first time that it is possible to silicify S-layer coated liposomes and to obtain stable functionalized hollow nano-containers. For this purpose, the S-layer protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus PV72/p2 was recombinantly expressed and used for coating positively charged liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and hexadecylamine in a molar ratio of 10:5:4. Subsequently, plain (uncoated) liposomes and S-layer coated liposomes were silicified. Determination of the charge of the constructs during silicification allowed the deposition process to be followed. After the particles had been silicified, lipids were dissolved by treatment with Triton X-100 with the release of previously entrapped fluorescent dyes being determined by fluorimetry. Both, ??-potential and release experiments showed differences between silicified plain liposomes and silicified S-layer coated liposomes. The results of the individual preparation steps were examined by embedding the respective assemblies in resin, ultrathin sectioning and inspection by bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Energy filtered TEM confirmed the successful construction of S-layer based silica cages. It is anticipated that this approach will provide a key to enabling technology for the fabrication of nanoporous protein cages for applications ranging from nano medicine to materials science. ?? 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

  abstract = {Despite the first report on the bacterial display of a recombinant peptide appeared almost 30 years ago, industrial application of cells with surface-displayed enzymes is still limited. To display an enzyme on the surface of a living cell bears several advantages. First of all, neither the substrate nor the product of the enzymatic reaction needs to cross a membrane barrier. Second, the enzyme being linked to the cell can be separated from the reaction mixture and hence the product by simple centrifugation. Transfer to a new substrate preparation results in multiple cycles of enzymatic conversion. Finally, the anchoring in a matrix, in this case, the cell envelope stabilizes the enzyme and makes it less accessible to proteolytic degradation and material adsorption resulting in continuous higher activities. These advantages in common need to balance some disadvantages before this application can be taken into account for industrial processes, e.g., the exclusion of the enzyme from the cellular metabolome and hence from redox factors or other co-factors that need to be supplied. Therefore, this digest describes the different systems in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that have been used for the surface display of enzymes so far and focuses on examples among these which are suitable for industrial purposes or for the production of valuable resources, not least in order to encourage a broader application of whole-cell biocatalysts with surface-displayed enzymes.},

  abstract = {The disruption of bacterial signaling (quorum quenching) has been proven to be an innovative approach to influence the behavior of bacteria. In particular, lactonase enzymes that are capable of hydrolyzing the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules used by numerous bacteria, were reported to inhibit biofilm formation, including those of freshwater microbial communities. However, insights and tools are currently lacking to characterize, understand and explain the effects of signal disruption on complex microbial communities. Here we produced silica capsules containing an engineered lactonase that exhibits quorum quenching activity. Capsules were used to design a filtration cartridge to selectively degrade AHLs from a recirculating bioreactor. The growth of a complex microbial community in the bioreactor, in the presence or absence of lactonase, was monitored over a 3 weeks period. Dynamic population analysis revealed that signal disruption using a quorum quenching lactonase can effectively reduce biofilm formation in the recirculating bioreactor system and that biofilm inhibition is concomitant to drastic changes in the composition, diversity and abundance of soil bacterial communities within these biofilms. Effects of the quorum quenching lactonase on suspension community also affected the microbial population composition, suggesting that effects of signal disruption are not limited to biofilm populations. This unexpected finding is evidence for the importance of signaling in the competition between bacteria within communities. This study provides foundational tools and data for the investigation of the importance of AHL-based signaling in the context of complex microbial communities.},

  abstract = {The power of a single engineered organism is limited by its capacity for genetic modification. To circumvent the constraints of any singular microbe, a new frontier in synthetic biology is emerging: synthetic ecology, or the engineering of microbial consortia. Here we develop communication systems for such consortia in an effort to allow for complex social behavior across different members of a community. We posit that such communities will outpace monocultures in their ability to perform complicated tasks if communication among and between members of the community is well regulated. Quorum sensing was identified as the most promising candidate for precise control of engineered microbial ecosystems, due to its large diversity and established utility in synthetic biology. Through promoter and protein modification, we engineered two quorum sensing systems (rpa and tra) to add to the extensively used lux and las systems. By testing the cross-talk between all systems, we thoroughly characterized many new inducible systems for versatile control of engineered communities. Furthermore, we've identified several system pairs that exhibit useful types of orthogonality. Most notably, the tra and rpa systems were shown to have neither signal crosstalk nor promoter crosstalk for each other, making them completely orthogonal in operation. Overall, by characterizing the interactions between all four systems and their components, these circuits should lend themselves to higher-level genetic circuitry for use in microbial consortia.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Alfalfa seeds inoculated with Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 were treated with ultrasound (38.5-40.5 kHz) in solutions containing 1\% Ca(OH)(2), 1\% Tween 80, 1\% Ca(OH)(2) plus 1\% Tween 80, 160 microg ml(-1) Tsunami 200 and 0.5\% Fit at 23 and 55 degrees C for 2 and 5 min. Highest reductions were in chemical solutions at 55 degrees C, but seed viability was also reduced compared with treatment at 23 degrees C. Inactivation of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 was generally enhanced by simultaneous treatments with ultrasound, chemicals and heat. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound treatment, in combination with chemicals and heat, had a modest enhancing effect on the effectiveness of chemicals in killing or removing pathogens on alfalfa seeds. Overall, treatment with 1\% Ca(OH)(2) was most effective in killing Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of 1\% Ca(OH)(2) instead of 20,000 microg ml(-1) chlorine, which is currently recommended as a sanitizer for seeds intended for sprout production in the US, should be considered. Ultrasound treatment of alfalfa seeds containing Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7, in combination with chemical treatment, contributes to achieving greater reductions in populations of these pathogens, thereby reducing the risk of contamination and the presence of pathogens in sprouts produced from these seeds.},

  abstract = {Cyanuric acid hydrolases (AtzD) and barbiturases are homologous, found almost exclusively in bacteria, and comprise a rare protein family with no discernible linkage to other protein families or an X-ray structural class. There has been confusion in the literature and in genome projects regarding the reaction products, the assignment of individual sequences as either cyanuric acid hydrolases or barbiturases, and spurious connection of this family to another protein family. The present study has addressed those issues. First, the published enzyme reaction products of cyanuric acid hydrolase are incorrectly identified as biuret and carbon dioxide. The current study employed (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to show that cyanuric acid hydrolase releases carboxybiuret, which spontaneously decarboxylates to biuret. This is significant because it revealed that homologous cyanuric acid hydrolases and barbiturases catalyze completely analogous reactions. Second, enzymes that had been annotated incorrectly in genome projects have been reassigned here by bioinformatics, gene cloning, and protein characterization studies. Third, the AtzD/barbiturase family has previously been suggested to consist of members of the amidohydrolase superfamily, a large class of metallohydrolases. Bioinformatics and the lack of bound metals both argue against a connection to the amidohydrolase superfamily. Lastly, steady-state kinetic measurements and observations of protein stability suggested that the AtzD/barbiturase family might be an undistinguished protein family that has undergone some resurgence with the recent introduction of industrial s-triazine compounds such as atrazine and melamine into the environment.},

Current models are phenomenological and specific to nutrient-rich, exponentially growing cells, thus cannot predict the first division under limiting nutrient availability. To assess this regime, we supplied starving Escherichia coli with glucose pulses at increasing frequencies. Real-time metabolomics and microfluidic single-cell microscopy revealed unexpected, rapid protein, and nucleic acid synthesis already from minuscule glucose pulses in non-dividing cells. Additionally , the lag time to first division shortened as pulsing frequency increased. We pinpointed division timing and dependence on nutrient frequency to the changing abundance of the division protein FtsZ. A dynamic, mechanistic model quantitatively relates lag time to FtsZ synthesis from nutrient pulses and FtsZ protease-dependent degradation. Lag time changed in model-congruent manners, when we experimentally modulated the synthesis or degradation of FtsZ. Thus, limiting abundance of FtsZ can quantitatively predict timing of the first cell division.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years there has been a great deal of interest in reducing experimental systems to a lab-on-a-chip scale. There has been particular interest in conducting high-throughput screening studies using microscale devices, for example in stem cell research. Microwells have emerged as the structure of choice for such tests. Most manufacturing approaches for microwell fabrication are based on photolithography, soft lithography, and etching. However, some of these approaches require extensive equipment, lengthy fabrication process, and modifications to the existing microwell patterns are costly. Here we show a convenient, fast, and low-cost method for fabricating microwells for cell culture applications by laser ablation of a polyester film coated with silicone glue. Microwell diameter was controlled by adjusting the laser power and speed, and the well depth by stacking several layers of film. By using this setup, a device containing hundreds of microwells can be fabricated in a few minutes to analyze cell behavior. Murine embryonic stem cells and human hepatoblastoma cells were seeded in polyester microwells of different sizes and showed that after 9 days in culture cell aggregates were formed without a noticeable deleterious effect of the polyester film and glue. These results show that the polyester microwell platform may be useful for cell culture applications. The ease of fabrication adds to the appeal of this device as minimal technological skill and equipment is required.},

  abstract = {Biotemplates from microbial origin have been a new source of inspiration for designing and fabricating intricate, high surface area structures that possess potent applications in nanotechnology. Microbial biotemplates are useful for synthesizing nano/micro structural materials based on a bottom up approach. Being from nature, microbial biotemplates with their extraordinarily molecular machinery have been reported to be considerably superior and cost effective for fabricating complex and heterogeneous structures when compared to the conventional and advanced lithographic techniques. The advantage of speedy growth and multiplication along with controlled shape, structure and size, make microorganisms a viable template for preparing nanomaterials of defined size and shape. In this review, we have consolidated the recent advances in the synthesis of nano/micro structures using biotemplates obtained from various types of microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, algae and virus, and have highlighted its possible applications. This review excludes biomolecules like DNA, protein and lipid based biotemplates extracted from various microorganisms.},

  abstract = {Soils represent a major sink for organic xenobiotic contaminants in the environment. The degree to which organic chemicals are retained within the soil is controlled by soil properties, such as organic matter, and the physico-chemical properties of the contaminant. Chemicals which display hydrophobic and lipophilic characteristics, as well as a recalcitrant chemical structure, will be retained within the soil, and depending on the `strength' of the association may persist for long periods of time. This review describes the behaviour of hydrophobic organic contaminants in soils, focusing on the mechanisms controlling interactions between soil and contaminants. The bioavailability of contaminants in soil is also discussed, particularly in relation to contact time with the soil. It considers the degradation of organic contaminants in soil and the mechanisms microbes use to access contaminants. Finally, the review discusses the `pros' and `cons' of chemical and biological techniques available for assessing bioavailability of hydrophobic organic chemicals in soils, highlighting the need to quantify bioavailability by chemical techniques. It concludes by highlighting the need for understanding the interactions between the soil, contaminants and biota which is crucial to understanding the bioavailability of contaminants in soils.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of electrons under conditions of environmental stress produces a reduced state in the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) system and causes the reduction of O2 by PSI in the thylakoid membranes to produce the reactive oxygen species superoxide radical, which irreversibly inactivates PSI. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism for the oxidation of reaction center Chl of PSI, P700, after saturated pulse (SP) light illumination of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 under steady-state photosynthetic conditions. Both P700 and NADPH were transiently oxidized after SP light illumination under CO2-depleted photosynthesis conditions. In contrast, the Chl fluorescence intensity transiently increased. Compared with the wild type, the increase in Chl fluorescence and the oxidations of P700 and NADPH were greatly enhanced in a mutant (Δflv1/3) deficient in the genes encoding FLAVODIIRON 1 (FLV1) and FLV3 proteins even under high photosynthetic conditions. Furthermore, oxidation of Cyt f was also observed in the mutant. After SP light illumination, a transient suppression of O2 evolution was also observed in Δflv1/3. From these observations, we propose that the reduction in the plastquinone (PQ) pool suppresses linear electron flow at the Cyt b6/f complex, which we call the reduction-induced suppression of electron flow (RISE) in the PET system. The accumulation of the reduced form of PQ probably suppresses turnover of the Q cycle in the Cyt b6/f complex.},

The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

  abstract = {TrzN, the broad-specificity triazine hydrolase from Arthrobacter and Nocardioides spp., is reportedly in the amidohydrolase superfamily of metalloenzymes, but previous studies suggested that a metal was not required for activity. To help resolve that conundrum, a double chaperone expression system was used to produce multimilligram quantities of functionally folded, recombinant TrzN. The TrzN obtained from Escherichia coli (trzN) cells cultured with increasing zinc in the growth medium showed corresponding increases in specific activity, and enzyme obtained from cells grown with 500 muM zinc showed maximum activity. Recombinant TrzN contained 1 mole of Zn per mole of TrzN subunit. Maximally active TrzN was not affected by supplementation with most metals nor by EDTA, consistent with previous observations (E. Topp, W. M. Mulbry, H. Zhu, S. M. Nour, and D. Cuppels, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66:3134-3141, 2000) which had led to the conclusion that TrzN is not a metalloenzyme. Fully active native TrzN showed a loss of greater than 90\% of enzyme activity and bound zinc when treated with the metal chelator 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. While exogenously added zinc or cobalt restored activity to metal-depleted TrzN, cobalt supported lower activity than did zinc. Iron, manganese, nickel, and copper did not support TrzN activity. Both Zn- and Co-TrzN showed different relative activities with different s-triazine substrates. Co-TrzN showed a visible absorption spectrum characteristic of other members of the amidohydrolase superfamily replaced with cobalt.},

Even closely related species may exhibit marked differences in biochemistry and behavior, and, under many conditions, similar, striking heterogeneity may exist within a clonal population of organisms which, in the aggregate, occupy too small a region of space to be visible to the unaided human eye. Using methods of microscopy, microspectrophotometry, and cytometry developed and refined since the 1960s, it is now possible to characterize the physiology and pharmacology of individual microorganisms, and, in many cases, to isolate organisms with selected characteristics for culture and/or further analysis. These methods include fluorescent and confocal microscopy, scanning and image cytometry, and flow cytometry. Fluorescence measurements are particularly important in single-cell analysis; they allow demonstration and quantification of cells' nucleic acid content and sequence, of the presence of specific antigens, and of physiologic characteristics such as enzyme activity and membrane potential. Multiparameter cytometry, combined with cell sorting, provides insight into population heterogeneity and allows selected cells to be separated for further analysis and culture. The technology is applicable to a wide range of problems in contemporary microbiology, including strain selection and the development of antimicrobial agents. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Flux balance analysis based on linear programming is applied to photoautotrophic metabolism. The stoichiometric network of a model photosynthetic prokaryote, Synechocystis sp.

Flux map topologies for the hetero-, auto-, and mixotrophic modes of metabolism under conditions of optimal growth were determined and compared.

Polymer coating systems are normally applied on a metal surface to provide a dense barrier against the corrosive species in order to protect metal structures from corrosive attack. When the barrier is damaged and the corrosive agents penetrate to the metal sur-face the coating system can not stop the corrosion process. The most effective solution so far for designing anticorrosion coatings for active protection of metals is to employ chro-mate-containing conversion coatings. [1] However, hexavalent chromium species are responsible for several diseases, includ-ing DNA damage and cancer, [2] which is the main reason for banning Cr 6+ -containing anticorrosion coatings in Europe from 2007. The deposition of thin inorganic or hybrid films on metallic surfaces has been suggested as a pretreatment to provide an additional barrier against the corrosion species and mainly to improve adhesion between the metal and polymer coating sys-tem. [3] The films are usually deposited by the plasma polymer-ization technique or the sol–gel route. Sol–gel-derived thin films that contain either inorganic (phosphates, vanadates, bo-rates, and cerium and molybdenum compounds) or organic (phenylphosphonic acid, mercaptobenzothiazole, mercapto-benzoimidazole, triazole) inhibitors are investigated as substi-tutes for chromates. [3a–e] Among them, the highest activity is shown for sol–gel coatings with a cerium dopant of a critical concentration in the 0.2–0.6 wt \% range. However, the nega-tive effect of the free inhibitor occluded in the sol–gel matrix on the stability of the protective film is observed for all types},

  abstract = {Super water- and oil-repellent surfaces have been made utilizing the fractal structure of the solid surfaces. Super water-repellent surfaces showing a contact angle of 160 degrees for water droplets have been made of anodically oxidized aluminum surfaces treated with hydrophobic surface coupling agent (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane). The fractal dimension of this surface was evaluated to be 2.19 by box counting fractal analysis. The anodically oxidized aluminum surface itself was superwettable for water (and also other solvents), and the surface hydrophobized with the surface coupling agent was altered to a super water-repellent surface. The super oil-repellent surfaces are also prepared by treating the same aluminum surface with fluorinated monoalkyl phosphates (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl- and -perfluorododecyl-phosphate). A rapeseed oil droplet having a surface tension of approximately 35 mN/m rolls around on the surface without attaching. The contact angle of the rapeseed oil on the super oil-repellent surface was 150 degrees. Most of the oils having a surface tension greater than 23 mN/m show greater contact angle than 120 degrees on the super-oil-repellent surfaces. The critical surface tension, gammac, was estimated to be 14.8 mN/m from the Zisman plot of the contact angles on the flat surface treated with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorododecyl phosphate. This value is between the gammac of Teflon (18.5 mN/m) and that of -CF3 group ( approximately 6 mN/m). Copyright 1998 Academic Press.},

Here we introduce high-phylogenetic-resolution microbiome mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization (HiPR-FISH), a versatile technology that uses binary encoding, spectral imaging and decoding based on machine learning to create micrometre-scale maps of the locations and identities of hundreds of microbial species in complex communities. We show that 10-bit HiPR-FISH can distinguish between 1,023 isolates of Escherichia coli, each fluorescently labelled with a unique binary barcode. HiPR-FISH, in conjunction with custom algorithms for automated probe design and analysis of single-cell images, reveals the disruption of spatial networks in the mouse gut microbiome in response to treatment with antibiotics, and the longitudinal stability of spatial architectures in the human oral plaque microbiome. Combined with super-resolution imaging, HiPR-FISH shows the diverse strategies of ribosome organization that are exhibited by taxa in the human oral microbiome. HiPR-FISH provides a framework for analysing the spatial ecology of environmental microbial communities at single-cell resolution.},

  abstract = {Cell shape matters across the kingdoms of life, and cells have the remarkable capacity to define and maintain specific shapes and sizes. But how are the shapes of micron-sized cells determined from the coordinated activities of nanometer-sized proteins? Here, we review general principles that have surfaced through the study of rod-shaped bacterial growth. Imaging approaches have revealed that polymers of the actin homolog MreB play a central role. MreB both senses and changes cell shape, thereby generating a self-organizing feedback system for shape maintenance. At the molecular level, structural and computational studies indicate that MreB filaments exhibit tunable mechanical properties that explain their preference for certain geometries and orientations along the cylindrical cell body. We illustrate the regulatory landscape of rod-shape formation and the connectivity between cell shape, cell growth, and other aspects of cell physiology. These discoveries provide a framework for future investigations into the architecture and construction of microbes. How do microbes maintain their shape? This review takes a closer look at the role played by the actin homolog MreB in controlling rod-shaped bacterial growth.},

The kinetics of BTEX biodegradation by immobilized cells adapted in the fibrous-bed bioreactor and free cells grown in serum bottles were studied. In general, the BTEX biodegradation rate increased with increasing substrate concentration and then decreased after reaching a maximum, showing substrate-inhibition kinetics. However, for immobilized cells, the degradation rate was much higher than that of free cells. Compared to free cells, immobilized cells in the bioreactor tolerated higher concentrations ({$>$}1000 mg l-1) of benzene and toluene, and gave at least 16-fold higher degradation rates for benzene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene, and a 9-fold higher degradation rate for toluene. Complete and simultaneous degradation of BTEX mixture was achieved in the bioreactor under hypoxic conditions. Cells in the bioreactor were relatively insensitive to benzene toxicity; this insensitivity was attributed to adaptation of the cells in the bioreactor. Compared to the original seeding culture, the adapted cells from the fibrous-bed bioreactor had higher specific growth rate, benzene degradation rate, and cell yield when the benzene concentration was higher than 100 mg l-1. Cells in the fibrous bed had a long, slim morphology, which is different from the normal short-rod shape found for suspended cells in solution. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Background: Biological silica production has drawn intense attention and several molecules involved in biosilicification have been identified. Cellular mechanisms, however, remain unknown mainly due to the lack of probes required for obtaining information on live specimens. Results: The fluorescence spectra of the compound 2-(4-pyridyl)-5-((4-(2-dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl)methoxy)phenyl) oxazole (PDMPO) are affected by the presence of {$>$} 3.2 mM silicic acid. Increase in intensity and shift in the fluorescence coincide with the polymerization of Si. The unique PDMPO-silica fluorescence is explored here to visualize Si deposition in living diatoms. The fluorophore is selectively incorporated and co-deposited with Si into the newly synthesized frustules (the outer silica shells) showing an intense green fluorescence. Conclusions: We suggest that a fluorescence shift is due to an interaction between PDMPO and polymeric silicic acid. PDMPO is an excellent probe for imaging newly deposited silica in living cells and has also a potential for a wide range of applications in various Si-related disciplines, including biology of living organisms as diatoms, sponges, and higher plants, clinical research (e.g. lung fibrosis and cancer, bone development, artificial bone implantation), and chemistry and physics of materials research. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, despite the ability of hydrogels to generate artificial ECM that can modulate cellular behavior, they often lack the mechanical strength needed for many tissue constructs. Here, we present reinforced CNT-gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hybrid as a biocompatible, cell-responsive hydrogel platform for creating cell-laden three-dimensional (3D) constructs. The addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) successfully reinforced GelMA hydrogels without decreasing their porosity or inhibiting cell growth. The CNT-GelMA hybrids were also photopatternable allowing for easy fabrication of microscale structures without harsh processes. NIH-3T3 cells and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) readily spread and proliferated after encapsulation in CNT-GelMA hybrid microgels. By controlling the amount of CNTs incorporated into the GelMA hydrogel system, we demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the hybrid material can be tuned making it suitable for various tissue engineering applications. Furthermore, due to the high pattern fidelity and resolution of CNT incorporated GelMA, it can be used for in vitro cell studies or fabricating complex 3D biomimetic tissue-like structures.},

Here we report the viability of E. coli cell extract prepared using equipment that is both common to biotechnology laboratories and able to process small volume samples. Specifically, we assessed the low-capital-cost lysis techniques of: (i) sonication, (ii) bead vortex mixing, (iii) freeze-thaw cycling, and (iv) lysozyme incubation to prepare E. coli cell extract for cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS). We also used simple shake flask fermentations with a commercially available E. coli strain. In addition, RNA polymerase was overexpressed in the E. coli cells prior to lysis, thus eliminating the need to add independently purified RNA polymerase to the CFPS reaction. As a result, high-yielding E. coli-based extract was prepared using equipment requiring a reduced capital investment and common to biotechnology laboratories. To our knowledge, this is the first successful prokaryote-based CFPS reaction to be carried out with extract prepared by sonication or bead vortex mixing.},

  abstract = {Quorum sensing in bacteria is a cell density-dependent phenomenon in which, a community of cells communicate with each other using signalling molecules belonging to various families of which N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) is one. AHL acts via ligand–receptor interaction where receptors of AHL differ from species to species, and possess great degree of similarity in conformation at the active site. A macromolecule, LasR, is a receptor protein that binds to N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserinelactone (OdDHL), a type of AHL, viz. responsible for biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similar macromolecule LuxR, like LasR, found in Vibrio sp. identifies a different AHL, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine~lactone (OhHSL), responsible for the phenomenon of bioluminescence. In silico study depicted that curcumin could bind to both LasR and LuxR by unique sets of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions that can lead to the inactivation of these proteins, enabling this plant-derived organic AHL antagonist to be categorized as a quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI). To prove this hypothesis, curcumin was treated on P. aeruginosa to access the reduction in biofilm formation and on V. alginolyticus to check its efficacy to reduction in bioluminescence by inhibition of QS. The results of these studies proved curcumin to be an efficient QSI.},

  abstract = {Microbial transformations of cyclic hydrocarbons have received much attention during the past three decades. Interest in the degradation of environmental pollutants as well as in applications of microorganisms in the catalysis of chemical reactions has stimulated research in this area. The metabolic pathways of various aromatics, cycloalkanes, and terpenes in different microorganisms have been elucidated, and the genetics of several of these routes have been clarified. The toxicity of these compounds to microorganisms is very important in the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons, but not many researchers have studied the mechanism of this toxic action. In this review, we present general ideas derived from the various reports mentioning toxic effects. Most importantly, lipophilic hydrocarbons accumulate in the membrane lipid bilayer, affecting the structural and functional properties of these membranes. As a result of accumulated hydrocarbon molecules, the membrane loses its integrity, and an increase in permeability to protons and ions has been observed in several instances. Consequently, dissipation of the proton motive force and impairment of intracellular pH homeostasis occur. In addition to the effects of lipophilic compounds on the lipid part of the membrane, proteins embedded in the membrane are affected. The effects on the membrane-embedded proteins probably result to a large extent from changes in the lipid environment; however, direct effects of lipophilic compounds on membrane proteins have also been observed. Finally, the effectiveness of changes in membrane lipid composition, modification of outer membrane lipopolysaccharide, altered cell wall constituents, and active excretion systems in reducing the membrane concentrations of lipophilic compounds is discussed. Also, the adaptations (e.g., increase in lipid ordering, change in lipid/protein ratio) that compensate for the changes in membrane structure are treated.},

In order to select the most adequate absorbent for molinate, different materials were tested, namely pine bark, activated carbon and resin Amberlite XAD-4. Activated carbon and resin Amberlite XAD-4 were the most efficient on the removal of molinate from solutions, although the activated carbon used proved not to be bio-regenerable. It was also observed that factors such as temperature, pH, and conductivity did not affect significantly molinate adsorption onto resin Amberlite XAD-4. Resin Amberlite XAD-4 was successfully bio-regenerated, being observed that biodegradation was mainly dependent on spontaneous desorption of the molinate. After bio-regeneration, the resin could be re-utilised as adsorbent. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Problems, which may arise when low-temperature nitrogen adsorption is used for the characterisation of porous materials, are discussed in this review. Continuous or discontinuous manometric techniques can be employed for nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K. For pore structure analysis, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms should be determined over the widest possible range of relative pressure, while allowing for slow equilibration and other operational problems, particularly at very low pressures. In spite of its artificial nature, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method is still used for the determination of surface area. In principle, nitrogen isotherms of Types II and IV are amenable to BET analysis provided that pores of molecular dimensions are absent and that the BET plot is obtained over an appropriate range of the isotherm. An empirical method based on the application of standard adsorption data is useful for checking the validity of the BET-area. All the computational procedures for pore size analysis have limitations of one sort or another. The various assumptions include an ideal pore shape, rigidity of the structure and an oversimplified model (capillary condensation or micropore filling). The derived pore widths and pore volumes should be regarded as effective (or apparent) values with respect to the adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

A special section examines the stepwise adsorption isotherms due to 2D phase changes in the physisorbed layer. After that, the empirical isotherm equations proposed by Freundlich, Sips, Toth, Jensen-Seaton and also Langmuir (for multisite adsorption) are introduced.

  abstract = {The assessment of microporosity is discussed in this chapter together with the interpretation of Type I adsorption isotherms and microcalorimetric data. Two different mechanisms of micropore filling are characterized by adsorption microcalorimetry and isotherm analysis. Thus, physisorption in pores of molecular dimensions involves enhanced adsorbent-adsorbate interactions and distortion of the corresponding isotherms at very low p/po, whereas wider micropores are filled over a range of higher p/po. The application of the various procedures for isotherm analysis requires critical appraisal. Although the Dubinin-Stoeckli and Horvath-Kawazoe methods are still widely used for evaluating the micropore size distribution, density functional theory has a number of advantages and is now being actively developed and improved. This method can be applied to adsorption isotherms of nitrogen at 77K and argon at 87K, the latter adsorptive becoming increasingly attractive for surface area determination and pore size analysis. Useful information obtained by a calorimetric approach is also discussed. Immersion microcalorimetry is of special interest for several reasons: with various immersion liquids, one can probe the micropore sizes by molecular sieving, or simply carry out a rapid screening of a set of adsorbents. Gas adsorption microcalorimetry provides an independent way of studying micropore filling and characterizing the various types of micropores. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

The 'classical' procedures for mesopore size analysis are then critically reviewed with particular attention given to the application of the popular Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) method.

While regulatory processes that detect changes in metabolic status/balance are relatively well-studied in plants, analogous pathways remain poorly characterized in photosynthetic microbes. Herein, we explore systemic changes that result from alterations in carbon availability in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 by taking advantage of an engineered strain where influx/efflux of a central carbon metabolite, sucrose, can be regulated experimentally. We observe that induction of a high-flux sucrose export pathway leads to depletion of internal carbon storage pools (glycogen), and concurrent increases in photosynthetic parameters. Further, a proteome-wide analysis and fluorescence reporter-based analysis revealed that upregulated factors following the activation of the metabolic sink are strongly concentrated on ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) and axillary modules involved in Rubisco maturation. Carboxysome number and Rubisco activity also increase following engagement of sucrose secretion. Conversely, reversing the flux of sucrose by feeding exogenous sucrose heterologously results in increased glycogen pools, decreased Rubisco abundance, decreased photosystem II quantum efficiency, and carboxysome reorganization. Our data suggest that Rubisco activity and organization are key outputs connected to regulatory pathways involved in metabolic balancing in cyanobacteria.

In this review, we highlight specific examples of logic gates engineering with applications towards fundamental understanding of network complexity and generating a novel socially useful applications.},

  abstract = {Surfactants are amphiphilic compounds which can reduce surface and interfacial tensions by accumulating at the interface of immiscible fluids and increase the solubility, mobility, bioavailability and subsequent biodegradation of hydrophobic or insoluble organic compounds. Chemically synthesized surfactants are commonly used in the petroleum, food and pharmaceutical industries as emulsifiers and wetting agents. Biosurfactants produced by some microorganisms are becoming important biotechnology products for industrial and medical applications due to their specific modes of action, low toxicity, relative ease of preparation and widespread applicability. They can be used as emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, wetting and foaming agents, functional food ingredients and as detergents in petroleum, petrochemicals, environmental management, agrochemicals, foods and beverages, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and in the mining and metallurgical industries. Addition of a surfactant of chemical or biological origin accelerates or sometimes inhibits the bioremediation of pollutants. Surfactants also play an important role in enhanced oil recovery by increasing the apparent solubility of petroleum components and effectively reducing the interfacial tensions of oil and water in situ. However, the effects of surfactants on bioremediation cannot be predicted in the absence of empirical evidence because surfactants sometimes stimulate bioremediation and sometimes inhibit it. For medical applications, biosurfactants are useful as antimicrobial agents and immunomodulatory molecules. Beneficial applications of chemical surfactants and biosurfactants in various industries are discussed in this review. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the basic theory of hydrogels and their important uses and applications in regenerative medicine. Hydrogels could be considered amorphous, semicrystalline, hydrogen bonded, or complexation products. They could be classified according to their source, that is, whether they are naturally derived or synthetic. Synthetic systems have a variety of options and might be homopolymer or copolymer systems. Synthetic polymers could also be synthesized to form interpenetrating polymer networks in which the two polymer sheets are physically entangled. Naturally derived systems may be polysaccharide or polypeptide-based and derived from numerous sources. Three important parameters that need to be considered in defining hydrogels are the volume fraction in the swollen state, the crosslink density, and the porosity of the hydrogel and these parameters could be described mathematically. The method of hydrogel formation is particularly important for maintaining bioactivity of molecules and for minimizing any detrimental effects to cells associated with the gels. A monomer or noncrosslinked polymer is found in the solution (sol) phase. Upon application of some initiation conditions, the sol phase forms the hydrogel (gel) phase; that is, it undergoes the sol-gel transition. For hydrogels containing bioactive molecules or cells, the high temperatures and many monomers, solvents, and polymerization initiators could not be used due to inactivation of bioactives or cytotoxicity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The isoporous lattices completely covering the cell surface provide organisms with various selection advantages including functioning as protective coats, molecular sieves and ion traps, as structures involved in surface recognition and cell adhesion, and as antifouling layers. S-layers are also identified to contribute to virulence when present as a structural component of pathogens. In Archaea, most of which possess S-layers as exclusive wall component, they are involved in determining cell shape and cell division. Studies on structure, chemistry, genetics, assembly, function, and evolutionary relationship of S-layers revealed considerable application potential in (nano)biotechnology, biomimetics, biomedicine, and synthetic biology.},

Many conventional diagnostics rely on antibody-based platforms that, although exquisitely sensitive, are slow and costly to generate and cannot readily confront rapidly emerging pathogens or be applied to orphan diseases. Synthetic biology, with its rational and short design-to-production cycles, has the potential to overcome many of these limitations. Synthetic biology devices, such as engineered gene circuits, bring new capabilities to molecular diagnostics, expanding the molecular detection palette, creating dynamic sensors, and untethering reactions from laboratory equipment. The field is also beginning to move toward in vivo diagnostics, which could provide near real-time surveillance of multiple pathological conditions. Here, we describe current efforts in synthetic biology, focusing on the translation of promising technologies into pragmatic diagnostic tools and platforms.},

Three different approaches toward the formation of nano-fibrous materials have emerged: self-assembly, electrospinning and phase separation. Each of these approaches is very different and has a unique set of characteristics, which lends to its development as a scaffolding system. For instance, self-assembly can generate small diameter nano-fibers in the lowest end of the range of natural extracellular matrix collagen, while electrospinning has only generated large diameter nano-fibers on the upper end of the range of natural extracellular matrix collagen. Phase separation, on the other hand, has generated nano-fibers in the same range as natural extracellular matrix collagen and allows for the design of macropore structures. These attempts at an artificial extracellular matrix have the potential to accommodate cells and guide their growth and subsequent tissue regeneration.},

Here, we use individual-based modeling to systematically vary cell shape and study its impact in simulated communities. We compete cells with different cell morphologies under a range of conditions and ask how shape affects the patterning and evolutionary fitness of cells within a community. Our models predict that cell shape will strongly influence the fate of a cell lineage: we describe a mechanism through which coccal (round) cells rise to the upper surface of a community, leading to a strong spatial structuring that can be critical for fitness. We test our predictions experimentally using strains of Escherichia coli that grow at a similar rate but differ in cell shape due to single amino acid changes in the actin homolog MreB. As predicted by our model, cell types strongly sort by shape, with round cells at the top of the colony and rod cells dominating the basal surface and edges. Our work suggests that cell morphology has a strong impact within microbial communities and may offer new ways to engineer the structure of synthetic communities.},

  abstract = {Background: Models of metabolism are often used in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research to identify drug targets or increase the direct production of valuable compounds. Due to the complexity of large metabolic systems, a number of conclusions have been drawn using mathematical methods with simplifying assumptions. For example, constraint-based models describe changes of internal concentrations that occur much quicker than alterations in cell physiology. Thus, metabolite concentrations and reaction fluxes are fixed to constant values. This greatly reduces the mathematical complexity, while providing a reasonably good description of the system in steady state. However, without a large number of constraints, many different flux sets can describe the optimal model and we obtain no information on how metabolite levels dynamically change. Thus, to accurately determine what is taking place within the cell, finer quality data and more detailed models need to be constructed. Results: In this paper we present a computational framework, DMPy, that uses a network scheme as input to automatically search for kinetic rates and produce a mathematical model that describes temporal changes of metabolite fluxes. The parameter search utilises several online databases to find measured reaction parameters. From this, we take advantage of previous modelling efforts, such as Parameter Balancing, to produce an initial mathematical model of a metabolic pathway. We analyse the effect of parameter uncertainty on model dynamics and test how recent flux-based model reduction techniques alter system properties. To our knowledge this is the first time such analysis has been performed on large models of metabolism. Our results highlight that good estimates of at least 80\% of the reaction rates are required to accurately model metabolic systems. Furthermore, reducing the size of the model by grouping reactions together based on fluxes alters the resulting system dynamics. Conclusion: The presented pipeline automates the modelling process for large metabolic networks. From this, users can simulate their pathway of interest and obtain a better understanding of how altering conditions influences cellular dynamics. By testing the effects of different parameterisations we are also able to provide suggestions to help construct more accurate models of complete metabolic systems in the future.},

The collection of strains was subdivided into a number of different groups. A first group, consisting of four strains, could be assigned to the previously described species Azoarcus tolulyticus. A second group (five strains) had DNA which reannealed highly to that of strains of the first group, and it is considered to represent a genomovar of A. tolulyticus. The third and fourth groups, composed of a total of five strains, represent a new species of Azoarcus, Azoarcus toluclasticus (group 3) and a genomovar of this species (group 4), respectively. Finally, the fifth group, with two strains, corresponds to another new species of the genus Azoarcus, Azoarcus toluvorans. In addition to these five groups, the collection includes five individual strains perhaps representing as many different new species. The above classification is partially consistent with the results of approaches other than DNA-DNA hybridization (electrophoretic patterns of whole-cell proteins and of the fragments obtained after digestion of total DNA with infrequently cutting restriction enzymes). On the other hand, no correlation of these groupings was found in terms of the cellular fatty acid composition. It is also unfortunate that no simple sets of easily determinable phenotypic properties could be defined as being characteristic of each of the groups.},

A detailed classification of these strains was performed using a polyphasic approach, which included studies on morphology, phenotypic characterization, fatty acid analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, 16S rRNA gene mapping (ribotyping) and DNA-DNA hybridization. The analyses of fatty acids and 16S rRNA gene sequencing differentiated strains 2FB2, 2FB6 and 4FB10 as new members of the genus Azoarcus and strains 4FB1, 4FB2, 3CB2, 3CB3 and 3BB1 as new members of the genus Thauera. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments established that strains 2FB2, 2FB6 and 4FB10 belong to the species Azoarcus tolulyticus. Strains 3CB2 and 3CB3 were assigned to the species Thauera aromatica on the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization and ribotyping experiments. Strains 4FB1, 4FB2 and 3BB1 showed close relatedness with strain 3CB-1T, previously described as T. aromatica genomovar chlorobenzoica. This group of strains is clearly differentiated from the species T. aromatica on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence analysis, DNA homology and ribotyping analysis. Strains 3CB-1T, 4FB1, 4FB2 and 3BB1 are proposed as members of the new species Thauera chlorobenzoica sp. nov., strain 3CB-1T (= ATCC 700723T) being the type strain.},

The amount of carbon in the silicon oxycarbide network has been controlled by varying the carbon load in the precursor gel. Density and surface area analysis revealed that all of the samples pyrolyzed at 1200°C were well-densified silicon oxycarbide glasses whereas for the glasses treated at 1000°C, compositions with low carbon loads showed the presence of a residual fine porous phase. The elastic modulus (E), flexural strength (MOR), and Vickers hardness (Hv) increase markedly with the amount of carbon in the oxycarbide glasses reaching the maximum values (E∼ 115 GPa, MOR ∼ 550 MPa, and Hv∼ 9 GPa) for samples with the highest carbon content. The experimental elastic modulus values of the silicon oxycarbide glasses compare well with the theoretical estimations obtained using the Voigt and Reuss models assuming the disordered network formed by the corresponding thermodynamic compositions.},

  abstract = {Acrylamide, widely employed as a vinyl monomer in the polymer industry, is a potent neurotoxin to man and to animals. The cumulative effect of prolonged, low-level exposure to acrylamide monomer is the insidious development of a progressive peripheral neuropathy. Sensory symptoms begin in the hands and feet (numbness, pins and needles), certain reflexes are lost and, with severe exposure, muscle weakness and atrophy occur in the extremities. The peripheral neuropathy may be supplemented by symptoms indicative of central nervous system damage (ataxia, tremor, somnolence and mental changes). The neuropathologic basis for this clinical picture has been determined in cats. Here, chronic acrylamide intoxication produces selective peripheral and central nerve fiber degeneration. Degeneration first occurs in the extremities of long and large nerve fibers which later undergo a progressive, seriate proximal axonal degeneration known as dying-back. Especially vulnerable are sensory axons supplying Pacinian corpuscles and muscle spindles in the hindfoot toepads, while adjacent motor nerve axons die back later. Distal central nerve fiber degeneration is seen in the medulla and the cerebellum. The neurotoxic property of acrylamide is of practical concern in two areas. One major problem is the protection of factory workers engaged in the manufacture of acrylamide. A sensitive test of neurologic function in these individuals, i.e., touch sensation, based on the experimental observation of the exquisite vulnerability of Pacinian corpuscles in acrylamide intoxicated cats, is presently under consideration. The second area for concern is the exposure of the populace to minute amounts of neurotoxic acrylamide monomer which contaminate acrylamide polymers currently deployed in the environment. Federal restrictions on the maximum permitted exposure to acrylamide, based on a largely clinical study of acrylamide neurotoxicity conducted ten years ago, may require a re-evaluation in the light of recent advances which have pinpointed the initial sites of nerve fiber degeneration.},

  abstract = {Due to their short lifespan, rapid division and ease of genetic manipulation, yeasts are popular model organisms for studying aging in actively dividing cells. To study replicative aging over many cell divisions, individual cells must be continuously separated from their progeny via a laborious manual microdissection procedure. Microfluidics-based soft-lithography devices have recently been used to automate microdissection of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, little is known about replicative aging in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a rod-shaped yeast that divides by binary fission and shares many conserved biological functions with higher eukaryotes. In this report, we develop a versatile multiphoton lithography method that enables rapid fabrication of three-dimensional master structures for PDMS-based microfluidics. We exploit the rapid-prototyping capabilities of multiphoton lithography to create and characterize a cell-capture device that is capable of high-resolution microscopic observation of hundreds of individual S. pombe cells. By continuously removing the progeny cells, we demonstrate that cell growth and protein aggregation can be tracked in individual cells for over \textasciitilde 100 hours. Thus, the fission yeast lifespan microdissector (FYLM) provides a powerful on-chip microdissection platform that will enable high-throughput studies of aging in rod-shaped cells.},

Here we present two novel filament-forming proteins in cyanobacteria. Surveying cyanobacterial genomes for coiled-coil-rich proteins (CCRPs) that are predicted as putative filament-forming proteins, we observed a higher proportion of CCRPs in filamentous cyanobacteria in comparison to unicellular cyanobacteria. Using our predictions, we identified nine protein families with putative intermediate filament (IF) properties. Polymerization assays revealed four proteins that formed polymers in vitro and three proteins that formed polymers in vivo. Fm7001 from Fischerella muscicola PCC 7414 polymerized in vitro and formed filaments in vivo in several organisms. Additionally, we identified a tetratricopeptide repeat protein - All4981 - in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 that polymerized into filaments in vitro and in vivo. All4981 interacts with known cytoskeletal proteins and is indispensable for Anabaena viability. Although it did not form filaments in vitro, Syc2039 from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 assembled into filaments in vivo and a Δsyc2039 mutant was characterized by an impaired cytokinesis. Our results expand the repertoire of known prokaryotic filament-forming CCRPs and demonstrate that cyanobacterial CCRPs are involved in cell morphology, motility, cytokinesis and colony integrity.},

  abstract = {Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels have been proposed as promising biomaterials to replace diseased or damaged articular cartilage. A critical barrier to their use as load-bearing tissue replacements is a lack of sufficient mechanical properties. The purpose of this study was to characterize the functional compressive and shear mechanical properties of a novel PVA hydrogel. Two formulations of the biomaterial were tested, one with a lower water content (75\% water), and the other with higher water content (80\% water). The compressive tangent modulus varied with biomaterial formulation and was found to be statistically strain magnitude and rate dependent. Over a strain range of 10-60\%, the compressive modulus increased from approximately 1-18MPa, which is within the range of the modulus of articular cartilage. The shear tangent modulus (0.1-0.4MPa) was also found to be strain magnitude dependent and within the range of normal human articular cartilage, but it was not statistically dependent on strain rate. This behavior was attributed to the dominance of fluid flow and related frictional drag on the viscoelastic behavior. Compressive failure of the hydrogels was found to occur between 45 and 60\% strain, depending on water content. Copyright ?? 2001 .},

The hydrophobicity of the aerogels was tested by measuring the contact angle (theta). The aerogels were also characterised by FTIR, DSC, and porosity measurements. Adsorption capacity measurements show that such modified hydrophobic silica aerogels are excellent adsorbents for different toxic organic compounds from water. In comparison to granulated active carbon (GAC) they exhibit capacities which are from 15 to 400 times higher for all tested compounds. Adsorption properties of hydrophobic silica aerogel remain stable even after 20 adsorption/desorption cycles.},

  abstract = {The N-end rule dictates that a protein's N-terminal residue determines its half-life. In bacteria, the ClpS adaptor mediates N-end-rule degradation, by recognizing proteins bearing specific N-terminal residues and delivering them to the ClpAP AAA+ protease. Unlike most bacterial clades, many α-proteobacteria encode two ClpS paralogs, ClpS1 and ClpS2. Here, we demonstrate that both ClpS1 and ClpS2 from A. tumefaciens deliver N-end-rule substrates to ClpA, but ClpS2 has more stringent binding specificity, recognizing only a subset of the canonical bacterial N-end-rule residues. The basis of this enhanced specificity is addressed by crystal structures of ClpS2, with and without ligand, and structure-guided mutagenesis, revealing protein conformational changes and remodeling in the substrate-binding pocket. We find that ClpS1 and ClpS2 are differentially expressed during growth in A. tumefaciens and conclude that the use of multiple ClpS paralogs allows fine-tuning of N-end-rule degradation at the level of substrate recognition.},

To achieve containment of transgenic microorganisms, confidence to a near-scientific certainty that they cannot transfer their transgenic genes to other organisms, and that they cannot survive to propagate in unintended environments, is a priority. Here, we present an in-depth summary of biological containment systems for micro-organisms published to date, including the production of a genetic firewall through genome recoding and physical containment of microbes using auxotrophies, regulation of essential genes, and expression of toxic genes. The level of containment required to consider a transgenic organism suitable for deployment is discussed, as well as standards of practice for developing new containment systems.},

All biomass components should be convertible into product, or otherwise into valuable coproduct. Too high bioreactor investments, due to high O2 requirements or too low productivities, should be avoided. Biochemical processes compete with chemical processes that aim at similar routes from biomass to product. The biochemical process should be more selective or should avoid production and isolation of intermediate chemicals.

  abstract = {Many biological applications require the segmentation of cell bodies, membranes and nuclei from microscopy images. Deep learning has enabled great progress on this problem, but current methods are specialized for images that have large training datasets. Here we introduce a generalist, deep learning-based segmentation method called Cellpose, which can precisely segment cells from a wide range of image types and does not require model retraining or parameter adjustments. Cellpose was trained on a new dataset of highly varied images of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly. Cellpose is a generalist, deep learning-based approach for segmenting structures in a wide range of image types. Cellpose does not require parameter adjustment or model retraining and outperforms established methods on 2D and 3D datasets.},

The phenomena which control the rate at which biodegradation proceeds are typically scale-dependent in nature. Failure to understand and account for scale-dependent variables, such as mass transport limitations, spatial heterogeneities and the prescence of competing microorganisms, may inhibit the effectiveness of field-scale bioremediation designs. This paper reviews and evaluates the methods available for characterization of the process effecting bioremediation at scales ranging from the laboratory to the field. Questions facing the field-scale practitioner of bioremediation are addressed in a manner which highlights the current state of research, the reliability of results and the extent to which laboratory-scale research accurately reflects common field conditions. Where gaps or inadequacies exist in our current knowledge or methods, research needs are identified. This review is intended to complement existing work by providing a framework from which to assess the importance of scale of observation to a particular result or conclusion, thereby providing an integrated approach to the scale-up process.},

We developed a novel microfluidics device that utilizes silicon micro-nozzle (MN) array, enabling to produce 50-200 microm calcium alginate beads with a narrow size distribution. Alginate aqueous solution was extruded through a precisely fabricated thin (30 microm x 30 microm) and short (500 microm) MN and was sheared by the viscous drag force of oil flow to form alginate droplets. Alginate droplets were immediately reacted with CaCl2 droplets at the downstream of oil flow to form calcium alginate gel beads. This device enabled us to successfully encapsulate living cells into 162 microm calcium alginate beads with maintaining viability, which was confirmed by the expression of marker protein.},

Environmental pollution is now recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to the World Health Organization, pollution is responsible for 8.9 million deaths around the world each year; of these, 94\% (8.4 million) are in LMICs. Toxic chemical pollution is growing into a major threat to children's health in LMICs. The disease and disability caused by environmental pollution have great economic costs, and these costs can undercut trajectories of national development. To combat pollution, improved programs of public health and environmental protection are needed in countries at every level of development. Pollution control strategies and technologies that have been developed in high-income countries must now be transferred to LMICs to assist these emerging economies to avoid the mistakes of the past. A new international clearinghouse is needed to define and track the health effects of pollution, quantify the economic costs of these effects, and direct much needed attention to environmental pollution as a risk factor for disease.},

In bovine serum albumin (BSA) entrapment efficiency study, initial BSA of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60\% w/w to polymer was incorporated into these alginate microparticles. The results revealed that F2 with initial BSA 10\% w/w showed the highest entrapment efficiency of 49.70 +/- 0.01\%. The result of BSA content revealed that F2' with the initial BSA of 20\% w/w showed the highest amount of BSA content of 3.92 +/- 0.02 mg g(-1) of particles. F1 and F2 with the initial BSA of 5\%, 20\% and 40\% w/w were chosen to evaluate for the release in PBS pH 7.4.

The results indicated that the coated microparticles were spherical and had a smooth surface, with an average size of 1-3 ??m, and were positively charged. In addition, the particles demonstrated a greater swelling and mucoadhesive properties than did uncoated microparticles. The in vitro release from the microparticles indicated that the coated microparticles resulted in more sustained release than uncoated microparticles. The cytotoxicity results showed that all of the formulations were safe.

Species-specific fabrication of this ornate biomineral enables taxonomists to identify thousands of diatom species. The molecular mechanisms that control this nanofabrication and generate the diversity of patterns is not well understood. A simple model is described, in which repeated phase separation events during wall biogenesis are assumed to produce self-similar silica patterns in smaller and smaller scales. On the basis of this single assumption, the apparently complex patterns found in the valves of the diatom genusCoscinodiscus can be predicted. Microscopic analysis of valves in statu nascendi from three different Coscinodiscusspecies supports the conclusions derived from the model.},

  abstract = {Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering, vehicles for drug delivery, actuators for optics and fluidics, and model extracellular matrices for biological studies. The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels have achieved stretches in the range 10-20, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10\,J\,m(-2) (ref. 8), as compared with ∼1,000\,J\,m(-2) for cartilage and ∼10,000\,J\,m(-2) for natural rubbers. Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100-1,000\,J\,m(-2) (refs 11, 14, 17). Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain ∼90\% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of ∼9,000\,J\,m(-2). Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels' toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications.},

Although it is known that the organization and subcellular localization of carboxysomes are dependent on external light conditions and are highly relevant to their functions, how carboxysome organization and function are actively orchestrated in natural diurnal cycles has remained elusive. Here, we explore the dynamic regulation of carboxysome positioning and carbon fixation in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 in response to diurnal light-dark cycles, using live-cell confocal imaging and Rubisco assays. We found that carboxysomes are prone to locate close to the central line along the short axis of the cell and exhibit a greater preference of polar distribution in the dark phase, coupled with a reduction in carbon fixation. Moreover, we show that deleting the gene encoding the circadian clock protein KaiA could lead to an increase in carboxysome numbers per cell and reduced portions of pole-located carboxysomes. Our study provides insight into the diurnal regulation of carbon fixation in cyanobacteria and the general cellular strategies of cyanobacteria living in natural habitat for environmental acclimation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This technique is employed to realize spatially selective deposition of CdTe nanoparticles on electrodes of indium\&\#8211;tin oxide (ITO). The fluorescence measurements prove that the selectivity of the film deposition increases against applied voltage and reaches 99\% when the voltage is 1.4 V. Upon further increase of the voltage, the selectivity slightly decreases. This decrease occurs because high voltage leads to a degradation of CdTe particles and thus reduces fluorescence intensity of the resultant CdTe film. However, fluorescence investigation indicates that a spacer layer of polyelectrolyte complex between the ITO electrode and the CdTe film is useful to protect the CdTe from being destroyed under high voltages.},

It comprises hundreds of protein homologs that self-assemble in space to form an icosahedral structure. Despite its significance in enhancing CO2 fixation and potentials in bioengineering applications, the formation of carboxysomes and their structural composition, stoichiometry, and adaptation to cope with environmental changes remain unclear. Here we use live-cell single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, coupled with confocal and electron microscopy, to decipher the absolute protein stoichiometry and organizational variability of single β-carboxysomes in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. We determine the physiological abundance of individual building blocks within the icosahedral carboxysome. We further find that the protein stoichiometry, diameter, localization, and mobility patterns of carboxysomes in cells depend sensitively on the microenvironmental levels of CO2 and light intensity during cell growth, revealing cellular strategies of dynamic regulation. These findings, also applicable to other bacterial microcompartments and macromolecular self-assembling systems, advance our knowledge of the principles that mediate carboxysome formation and structural modulation. It will empower rational design and construction of entire functional metabolic factories in heterologous organisms, for example crop plants, to boost photosynthesis and agricultural productivity.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic cyanobacteria are important primary producers and model organisms for studying photosynthesis and elements cycling on earth. Due to the ability to absorb sunlight and utilize carbon dioxide, cyanobacteria have also been proposed as renewable chassis for carbon-neutral “microbial cell factories”. Recent progresses on cyanobacterial synthetic biology have led to the successful production of more than two dozen of fuels and fine chemicals directly from CO2, demonstrating their potential for scale-up application in the future. However, compared with popular heterotrophic chassis like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where abundant genetic tools are available for manipulations at levels from single gene, pathway to whole genome, limited genetic tools are accessible to cyanobacteria. Consequently, this significant technical hurdle restricts both the basic biological researches and further development and application of these renewable systems. Though still lagging the heterotrophic chassis, the vital roles of genetic tools in tuning of gene expression, carbon flux re-direction as well as genome-wide manipulations have been increasingly recognized in cyanobacteria. In recent years, significant progresses on developing and introducing new and efficient genetic tools have been made for cyanobacteria, including promoters, riboswitches, ribosome binding site engineering, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated nuclease (CRISPR/Cas) systems, small RNA regulatory tools and genome-scale modeling strategies. In this review, we critically summarize recent advances on development and applications as well as technical limitations and future directions of the genetic tools in cyanobacteria. In addition, toolboxes feasible for using in large-scale cultivation are also briefly discussed.},

Spatial order is required for faithful and efficient cellular replication and offers a powerful means for the development of unique biological properties. Here, we discuss organizational features of bacterial cells and highlight how bacteria have evolved diverse spatial mechanisms to overcome challenges cells face as self-replicating entities. In contrast to the historical view that bacteria are “simple” life forms, many studies have begun to uncover the exquisite subcellular organization that underlies many critical processes for bacterial life. This Review explores the principles of spatial organization that contribute to bacterial cell growth, division, gene expression, inheritance, motility, metabolism, and beyond.},

The spatial struc- ture of a system constrains who interacts with whom (interaction partner) and who acquires new traits from whom (role model). Understanding when and to what degree a spatial structure affects the evolution of cooperation is an important and challenging topic. Here, we provide an analytical formula to predict when natural selection favours cooperation where the effects of a spatial structure are described by a single parameter. We find that a spatial structure promotes cooperation (spatial reciprocity) when interaction partners overlap role models. When they do not, spatial structure inhibits cooperation even without cooperation dilemmas. Further- more, a spatial structure in which individuals interact with their role models more often shows stronger reciprocity. Thus, imitating individuals with frequent interactions facilitates cooperation. Our findings are applicable to both pairwise and group interactions and show that strong social ties might hinder, while asymmetric spatial structures for interaction and trait dispersal could promote cooperation. 1.},

They are composed of a selectively permeable protein shell that encapsulates Rubisco, the principal CO2-fixing enzyme, and carbonic anhydrase. As the centerpiece of the carbonconcentrating mechanism, by packaging enzymes that collectively enhance catalysis, the carboxysome shell enables the generation of a locally elevated concentration of substrate CO2 and the prevention of CO2 escape. A functional carboxysome consisting of an intact shell and cargo is essential for cyanobacterial growth under ambient CO2 concentrations. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we have determined the structure of a recombinantly produced simplified b-carboxysome shell. The structure reveals the sidedness and the specific interactions between the carboxysome shell proteins. The model provides insight into the structural basis of selective permeability of the carboxysome shell and can be used to design modifications to investigate the mechanisms of cargo encapsulation and other physiochemical properties such as permeability. Notably, the permeability properties are of great interest for modeling and evaluating this carbon-concentrating mechanism in metabolic engineering. Moreover, we find striking similarity between the carboxysome shell and the structurally characterized, evolutionarily distant metabolosome shell, implying universal architectural principles for bacterial microcompartment shells.},

GFP-S65T was brightly fluorescent in solution (λ(ex)492 nm, λ(em) 509 nm) with a lifetime of 2.9 ns and a rotational correlation time (t(c)) of 20 ns. Recovery of GFP fluorescence after photobleaching was complete with a half-time (t 1/4 ) in aqueous saline of 30 ± 2 ms (5-μm diameter spot), giving a diffusion coefficient of 8.7 x 10-7cm2/s. The t 1/4 was proportional to solution viscosity and was dependent on spot diameter. In contrast to fluorescein, GFP photobleaching efficiency was not affected by solution O2content, triplet state quenchers, singlet oxygen scavengers, and general radical quenchers. In solutions of higher viscosity, an additional, rapid GFP recovery process was detected and ascribed to reversible photobleaching. The t 1/4 for reversible photobleaching was 1.5-5.5 ms (relative viscosity 5-250), was independent of spot diameter, and was unaffected by O2or quenchers. In cell cytoplasm, time-resolved microfluorimetry indicated a GFP lifetime of 2.6 ns and at(c) of 36 ± 3 ns, giving a relative viscosity (cytoplasm versus water) of 1.5. Photobleaching recovery of GFP in cytoplasm was 82 ± 2\% complete with a t 1/4 of 83 ± 6 ms, giving a relative viscosity of 3.2.GFP translational diffusion increased 4.7- fold as cells swelled from a relative volume of 0.5 to 2.

  abstract = {Metagenomics has revealed hundreds of species in almost all microbiota. In a few well-studied cases, microbial communities have been observed to coordinate their metabolic fluxes. In principle, microbes can divide tasks to reap the benefits of specialization, as in human economies. However, the benefits and stability of an economy of microbial specialists are far from obvious. Here, we physically model the population dynamics of microbes that compete for steadily supplied resources. Importantly, we explicitly model the metabolic fluxes yielding cellular biomass production under the constraint of a limited enzyme budget. We find that population dynamics generally leads to the coexistence of different metabolic types. We establish that these microbial consortia act as cartels, whereby population dynamics pins down resource concentrations at values for which no other strategy can invade. Finally, we propose that at steady supply, cartels of competing strategies automatically yield maximum biomass, thereby achieving a collective optimum.Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. Like other organisms, microbes grow by using enzymes to convert nutrients into proteins, DNA and other molecules that make up their cells. Together, these chemical transformations define the “metabolism” of a microbe.In any given environment, there is almost always a diverse variety of microbes living together. Different microbes in these communities will use different combinations of enzymes to exploit the available nutrients, and members of well-studied communities have been found to work together to make the most of the nutrient source. This is remarkable because one might expect competition between microbes to select for a single “best” microbe, rather than diverse communities.The economic concept of “division of labor” suggests that if microbes divide chemical tasks between each other, they will use the available resources more efficiently. The concept provides a possible explanation for metabolic diversity amongst microbes, yet it remains to be shown whether microbial communities actually benefit from a division of labor.Here, Taillefumier et al. used mathematical models to reveal that even in a uniform environment, metabolic competition generally leads to the steady coexistence of distinct microbes, collectively called a “consortium”. In a consortium, distinct microbes organize themselves to create a community-level metabolism that best exploits the nutrients present. The models showed that while growing, a consortium depletes the available pool of nutrients to such low levels that only members of the consortium can survive. The findings suggest that the benefit of metabolic diversity stems from the ability of a consortium to automatically deplete nutrients to levels at which no other microbes can invade.Taillefumier et al. propose that consortia that arise naturally under conditions where there is a steady supply of nutrients produce the maximum mass of microbes. Future experiments that analyze the impact of fluctuating nutrient supply may help us to understand the benefit of metabolic diversity in real-world microbial communities.},

Currently, there are many specialized methods that can be used to extract pure biomolecules, such as solution-based and column-based protocols. Manual method has certainly come a long way over time with various commercial offerings which included complete kits containing most of the components needed to isolate nucleic acid, but most of them require repeated centrifugation steps, followed by removal of supernatants depending on the type of specimen and additional mechanical treatment. Automated systems designed for medium-to-large laboratories have grown in demand over recent years. It is an alternative to labor-intensive manual methods.

The ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement of organic and inorganic layers is believed to be the most essential strength- and toughness-determining structural feature of nacre. It has also been found that the ionic crosslinking of tightly folded macromolecules is equally important. Here, we demonstrate that both structural features can be reproduced by sequential deposition of polyelectrolytes and clays. This simple process results in a nanoscale version of nacre with alternating organic and inorganic layers. The macromolecular folding effect reveals itself in the unique saw-tooth pattern of differential stretching curves attributed to the gradual breakage of ionic crosslinks in polyelectrolyte chains. The tensile strength of the prepared multilayers approached that of nacre, whereas their ultimate Young modulus was similar to that of lamellar bones. Structural and functional resemblance makes clay- polyelectrolyte multilayers a close replica of natural biocomposites. Their nanoscale nature enables elucidation of molecular processes occurring under stress.},

However, containment of GMMs to prevent environmental escape and satisfy regulatory requirements is a bottleneck for real-world use. While current biochemical strategies restrict unwanted growth of GMMs in the environment, there is a need for deployable physical containment technologies to achieve redundant, multi-layered and robust containment. We developed a hydrogel-based encapsulation system that incorporates a biocompatible multilayer tough shell and an alginate-based core. This deployable physical containment strategy (DEPCOS) allows no detectable GMM escape, bacteria to be protected against environmental insults including antibiotics and low pH, controllable lifespan and easy retrieval of genomically recoded bacteria. To highlight the versatility of DEPCOS, we demonstrated that robustly encapsulated cells can execute useful functions, including performing cell–cell communication with other encapsulated bacteria and sensing heavy metals in water samples from the Charles River.},

T4MO oxidized toluene (12.1+/-0.8 nmol/min/mg protein at 109 microM), naphthalene (7.7+/-1.5 nmol/min/mg protein at 5 mM), and fluorene (0.68+/-0.04 nmol/min/mg protein at 0.2 mM) faster than the other wildtype enzymes (2-22-fold) and produced a mixture of 1-naphthol (52\%) and 2-naphthol (48\%) from naphthalene, which was successively transformed to a mixture of 2,3-, 2,7-, 1,7-, and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalenes (7\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 63\%, respectively). TOM and ToMO made 1,7-dihydroxynaphthalene from 1-naphthol, and ToMO made a mixture of 2,3-, 2,6-, 2,7-, and 1,7-dihydroxynaphthalene (26\%, 22\%, 1\%, and 44\%, respectively) from 2-naphthol. TOM had no activity on 2-naphthol, and T4MO had no activity on 1-naphthol. To take advantage of the high activity of wildtype T4MO but to increase its regiospecificity on naphthalene, seven engineered enzymes containing mutations in T4MO alpha hydroxylase TmoA were examined; the selectivity for 2-naphthol by T4MO I100A, I100S, and I100G was enhanced to 88-95\%, and the selectivity for 1-naphthol was enhanced to 87\% and 99\% by T4MO I100L and G103S/A107G, respectively, while high oxidation rates were maintained except for G103S/A107G. Therefore, the regiospecificity for naphthalene oxidation was altered to practically pure 1-naphthol or 2-naphthol. All four wildtype monooxygenases were able to oxidize fluorene to different monohydroxylated products; T4MO oxidized fluorene successively to 3-hydroxyfluorene and 3,6-dihydroxyfluorene, which was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. TOM and its variant TomA3 V106A oxidize fluorene to a mixture of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyfluorene.

  abstract = {Whole cell biocatalysis is an important tool for pharmaceutical intermediates synthesis, although it is hindered by some shortcomings, such as high cost and toxicity of inducer, mass transfer resistance caused by cell membrane and side reactions. Whole-cell catalysis using N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.8) and N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) aldolase (EC 4.1.3.3) is a promising approach for the production of Neu5Ac, a potential precursor of many anti-viral drugs. A powerful catalyst was developed by packaging the enzymes in an engineered bacterium and using a safe temperature-induced vector. Since the mass transfer resistance and the side reactions were substantially reduced, a high Neu5Ac amount (191 mM) was achieved. An efficient method was also presented, which allows one-pot synthesis of Neu5Ac with a safe and economic manner. The results highlight the promise of large-scale Neu5Ac synthesis and point at a potential of our approach as a general strategy to improve whole-cell biocatalysis.},

It is naturally competent for transformation-that is, it takes up DNA from the environment, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we use a genome-wide screen to identify genes required for natural transformation in S. elongatus, including genes encoding a conserved Type IV pilus, genes known to be associated with competence in other bacteria, and others. Pilus biogenesis occurs daily in the morning, while natural transformation is maximal when the onset of darkness coincides with the dusk circadian peak. Thus, the competence state in cyanobacteria is regulated by the circadian clock and can adapt to seasonal changes of day length.},

We further evaluated these NOT gates by controlling the expression of the ftsZ gene, which encodes a prokaryotic tubulin homologue that is required for cell division and is essential for Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.

The resulting bacterial biosensor--Burkholderia sp. strain RP037--produced significant amounts of GFP after batch incubation in the presence of phenanthrene crystals. Co-incubation with acetate did not disturb the phenanthrene-specific response but resulted in a homogenously responding population of cells. Active metabolism was required for induction with phenanthrene. The magnitude of GFP induction was influenced by physical parameters affecting the phenanthrene flux to the cells, such as the contact surface area between solid phenanthrene and the aqueous phase, addition of surfactant, and slow phenanthrene release from Model Polymer Release System beads or from a water-immiscible oil. These results strongly suggest that the bacterial biosensor can sense different phenanthrene fluxes while maintaining phenanthrene metabolism, thus acting as a genuine sensor for phenanthrene bioavailability. A relationship between GFP production and phenanthrene mass transfer is proposed.},

  abstract = {Loss or duplication of chromosome segments can lead to further genomic changes associated with cancer. However, it is not known whether only a select subset of genes is responsible for driving further changes. To determine whether perturbation of any given gene in a genome suffices to drive subsequent genetic changes, we analyzed the yeast knockout collection for secondary mutations of functional consequence. Unlike wild-type, most gene knockout strains were found to have one additional mutant gene affecting nutrient responses and/or heat-stress-induced cell death. Moreover, independent knockouts of the same gene often evolved mutations in the same secondary gene. Genome sequencing identified acquired mutations in several human tumor suppressor homologs. Thus, mutation of any single gene may cause a genomic imbalance, with consequences sufficient to drive adaptive genetic changes. This complicates genetic analyses but is a logical consequence of losing a functional unit originally acquired under pressure during evolution. •Knockouts of the same gene evolve similarly without applied environmental pressure•Yeast knockouts harbor meaningful second mutations that challenge genetic analyses•Common assumptions about problems with yeast knockout collections are unlikely•First (engineered) and evolved yeast mutations also co-occur in human tumors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Materials such as polymer, composites, ceramic and metal nanofibres have been fabricated using electrospinning directly or through post-spinning processes. However, what makes electrospinning different from other nanofibre fabrication processes is its ability to form various fibre assemblies. This will certainly enhance the performance of products made from nanofibres and allow application specific modifications. It is therefore vital for us to understand the various parameters and processes that allow us to fabricate the desired fibre assemblies. Fibre assemblies that can be fabricated include nonwoven fibre mesh, aligned fibre mesh, patterned fibre mesh, random three-dimensional structures and sub-micron spring and convoluted fibres. Nevertheless, more studies are required to understand and precisely control the actual mechanics in the formation of various electrospun fibrous assemblies.},

  abstract = {The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.},

FtsZ is widely conserved in photosynthetic eukaryotes, where it forms a ring inside the organelle at the chloroplast division site. A distinctive feature of chloroplast division systems is the evolution of two phylogenetically and structurally distinct FtsZ families by independent gene duplications in different photosynthetic lineages. While many functional aspects of these proteins remain unknown, recent studies on the biochemical and dynamic properties of FtsZs from land plants, in combination with ongoing research on bacterial FtsZs, have begun to suggest mechanisms by which two functionally distinct FtsZ proteins may cooperate to drive chloroplast division. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model is formed using arrays of time-shared, holographic optical traps in conjunction with microfluidics to precisely position bacteria, and then encapsulated within a hydrogel that mimics the extracellular matrix. Using fluorescent protein reporters functionally linked to QS genes, we assay the intercellular signaling. We find that there isn't a single cell density for which QS-regulated genes are induced or repressed. On the contrary, cell-to-cell signaling is largely governed by diffusion, and is acutely sensitive to mass-transfer to the surroundings and the cell location. These observations are consistent with the view that QS-signals act simply as a probe measuring mixing, flow, or diffusion in the microenvironment of the cell.},

Among the available fabrication methods, the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of multilayer films onto colloidal particles followed by selective template removal has attracted extensive attention due to its advantages of precise control over the size, shape, composition, wall thickness and functions of the obtained capsules. The past decade has witnessed a rapid increase of research concerning the new fabrication strategies, functionalization and applications of this kind of capsules, particularly in the biomedical fields such as drug delivery, biosensors and bioreactors. In this critical review, the very recent progress of the multilayer capsules is summarized. First, the advances in assembly of capsules by the LbL technique are introduced with focus on tailoring the properties of hydrogen-bonded multilayer capsules by cross-linking, and fabrication of capsules based on covalent bonding and bio-specific interactions. Then the fabrication strategies which can speed up capsule fabrication are reviewed. In the following sections, the multi-compartmental capsules and the capsules that can transform their shape under stimulus are presented. Finally, the biomedical applications of multilayer capsules with particular emphasis on drug carriers, biosensors and bioreactors are described (306 references).},

  abstract = {Objective-To evaluate the effect of 4 antiarrhythmic treatment protocols on number of ventricular premature complexes (VPC), severity of arrhythmia, heart rate (HR), and number of syncopal episodes in Boxers with ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Design-Randomized controlled clinical trial. Animals-49 Boxers. Procedure-Dogs with {$>$} 500 VPC/24 h via 24-hour ambulatory ECG (AECG) were treated with atenolol (n = 11), procainarnice (11), sotalol (16), or mexiletine and atenolol (11) for 21 to 28 days, Results of pre- and posttreatment AECG were compared with regard to number of VPC/24 h; maximum, mean, and minimum HR; severity of arrhythmia; and occurrence of syncope. Results-Significant differences between pre- and posttreatment number of VPC, severity of arrhythmia, HR variables, or occurrence of syncope were not observed in dogs treated with atenoiol or procainamide. Significant reductions in number of VPC, severity of arrythmia, and maximum and mean HR were observed in dogs treated with mexiletine-atenolol or sotalol; occurrence of syncope was not significantly different between these 2 treatment groups, Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Treatment with sotalol or mexiletine-atenolol was well tolerated and efficacious. Treatment with procainamide or atenolol was not effective.},

These characteristics make them as potential recognition and catalytic agents in different fields. Attempts have been made to utilize their harness by immobilizing them in suitable matrices/supports. In recent years sol-gel technology has appeared as a greatly promising tool in entrapment of active biomolecules. The introduction of various organic functional groups, such as amino, glycidoxy, epoxy, hydroxyl, etc., into alkoxide monomers leads to organically modified sol-gel glasses (ormosil). The preparation of such organic/inorganic composites provides a means to produce silicate materials with continuously tunable chemical and physical properties by simply changing the precursors employed, their molar ratio, or both. Recently ormosils have been employed in multifarious applications in industrial and medical fields and show promising results in preserving native activity of biomolecules. This review article discusses about the basic chemistry, characterization, advances and biosensor applications of ormosil.

  abstract = {Global land resources are under severe threat due to pollution and unsustainable land use practices. Restoring degraded land is imperative for regaining ecosystem services, such as biodiversity maintenance and nutrient and water cycling, and to meet the food, feed, fuel, and fibre requirements of present and future generations. While bioremediation is acknowledged as a promising technology for restoring polluted and degraded lands, its field potential is limited for various reasons. However, recent biotechnological advancements, including producing efficient microbial consortia, applying enzymes with higher degrees of specificity, and designing plants with specific microbial partners, are opening new prospects in remediation technology. This review provides insights into such promising ways to harness biotechnology as ecofriendly methods for remediation and restoration. Global land degradation negatively affects the ecosystem services offered by land systems. Biotechnological advancements (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) can be exploited for restoring degraded lands for multipurpose environmental benefits. Customized (site-specific, pollutant-specific, and cost-effective) packages are essential for successful restoration programs. Restoration efforts must also be targeted for obtaining bioproducts for supporting a bio-based economy.},

However, the introduction of heterologous circuits into the host can create a substantial metabolic burden that limits the overall productivity of the system. This limitation could be overcome by metabolic division of labor (DOL), whereby distinct populations perform different steps in a metabolic pathway, reducing the burden each population will experience. While conceptually appealing, the conditions when DOL is advantageous have not been rigorously established. Here, we have analyzed 24 common architectures of metabolic pathways in which DOL can be implemented. Our analysis reveals general criteria defining the conditions that favor DOL, accounting for the burden or benefit of the pathway activity on the host populations as well as the transport and turnover of enzymes and intermediate metabolites. These criteria can help guide engineering of metabolic pathways and have implications for understanding evolution of natural microbial communities.},

The initial level of rapid adsorption of the dye also increased with heating time, although it remained roughly constant during post-heating incubation. The results obtained suggest that the permeability barrier to the dye in the outer membrane was damaged by heat stress and was repaired after sublethal heating. RNA, protein and lipid syntheses, as well as an energy-yielding process, appeared to be necessary for the repair of impermeability to the dye.},

Various studies have shown that some OH-PCBs can potentially contribute to health problems. Detection of these compounds in environmental and biological samples could provide useful information about their levels and lead to a better understanding of their apparent toxicity. To that end, we have developed a whole-cell sensing system for the detection of OH-PCBs by taking advantage of the recognition of a group of related compounds, i.e., hydroxylated biphenyls, by the product of the hbpR gene in the hbp operon from Pseudomonas azelaica strain HBP1. By fusing the luxAB genes, encoding the reporter protein bacterial luciferase, to the hbp regulator-promoter sequence, a whole-cell sensing system was developed. Here, we describe the optimization and application of this whole-cell sensing system for the detection of a model compound, 2-hydroxy-3',4'-dichlorobiphenyl. A detection limit of 1 x 10(-8) M was achieved using this system. The detection of a broad range of individual OH-PCBs as well as an OH-PCB mixture was investigated. The system can detect OH-PCBs in whole serum samples in a trace amount, which is comparable to the detection of these analytes in medium alone. We envision that the method developed can potentially be employed as a rapid and sensitive way to monitor OH-PCBs for toxicological study in the laboratory, as well as a useful tool to evaluate the presence of bioavailable OH-PCBs in natural environments.},

A riboregulator is a nature-inspired RNA tool, which is composed of two artificially designed RNA fragments. Owing to its high specificity and efficacy, it is suitable for metabolic engineering in cyanobacteria, and several studies have been done to optimize and improve the function of the riboregulator.

The released DAAO was rapidly inactivated in the absence of ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid (EDTA), beta-mercaptoethanol, and glycerol. DAAO within the permeabilized cells did not require these stabilizing agents. Treating the CTAB-permeabilized cells with 0.2\% glutaraldehyde (GA) at 4 degrees C for 10 min prevented the leakage of both DAAO and catalase. Alternately, stabilized whole cell DAAO and catalase was prepared by treating the whole yeast cells with 1\% GA at 4 degrees C for 60 min, followed by permeabilization with CTAB, a method which was equally efficient but easy to scale up. CTAB-permeabilized cells converted D-phenylalanine to 97\% phenylpyruvate and 3\% phenylacetate, and these cells were reused up to 3 cycles in a batchwise reaction. On the other hand, GA-treated CTAB-permeabilized cells produced more than 99\% phenylpyruvate and the cells could be reused up to 20 cycles.},

The polycationic agents were the protamine salmine, a lysine polymer with 20 lysine residues (lysine2g), and the deacylated polymyxin B derivative polymyxin B nonapeptide. Two different types of outer membrane-dis\&\$anizing action were foupd. Protamine and lysine20 released 20 to 30\%o of the lipopohlys\&charide from the outer membrane and sensitized the bacteria to the anioniq detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate but did not (under these conditions) make the bacteria permeable to the hydrophobic probes fusidic acid and actino-mycin'D. In contrast, polymyxin B nonapeptide did not release lipopolysaccha-ride'or 'sensitize the bacteria to sodium dodecyl sulfate but made the outer membrane permeable to the hydrophobic probes. None of the agents was bactericidal under the conditions used or caused any leakage of periplasmic ,B-lactamase. Polymyxin B was used as a reference and showe4 characteristic outer membrane-disorganizing action. In thin-section electron microscopy, polymyxin B nQnapeptide caused the appearance of long, narrow, finger-like projections on the outer membrane. Protamine and lysine20 caused a distinctly wrinkled appear-ance of the outer membrane but no projections. In the accompanying paper (30), we showed that growth in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of a number of polycationic agents sensitizes smooth enteric bacteria to the hydrophobic antibiotics to which these bacteria are very resistant by nature. The active polycat-ionic agents included protamine, a lysine poly-mer with 20 residues (lysine2O), and a polymyxin derivative, polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN),},

  abstract = {The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria provides the cell with an effective permeability barrier against external noxious agents, including antibiotics, but is itself a target for antibacterial agents such as polycations and chelators. Both groups of agents weaken the molecular interactions of the lipopolysaccharide constituent of the outer membrane. Various polycations are able, at least under certain conditions, to bind to the anionic sites of lipopolysaccharide. Many of these disorganize and cross the outer membrane and render it permeable to drugs which permeate the intact membrane very poorly. These polycations include polymyxins and their derivatives, protamine, polymers of basic amino acids, compound 48/80, insect cecropins, reptilian magainins, various cationic leukocyte peptides (defensins, bactenecins, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, and others), aminoglycosides, and many more. However, the cationic character is not the sole determinant required for the permeabilizing activity, and therefore some of the agents are much more effective permeabilizers than others. They are useful tools in studies in which the poor permeability of the outer membrane poses problems. Some of them undoubtedly have a role as natural antibiotic substances, and they or their derivatives might have some potential as pharmaceutical agents in antibacterial therapy as well. Also, chelators (such as EDTA, nitrilotriacetic acid, and sodium hexametaphosphate), which disintegrate the outer membrane by removing Mg2+ and Ca2+, are effective and valuable permeabilizers.},

  abstract = {Granular activated carbon (GAC) was evaluated as a suitable sorbent for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) removal from aqueous solutions. For this purpose, kinetic measurements on the extraction of a family of six PAHs were taken. A morphology study was performed by means of a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of GAC samples. Analyses of the batch rate data for each PAH were carried out using two kinetic models: the homogenous particle diffusion model (HPDM) and the shell progressive model (SPM). The process was controlled by diffusion rate the solutes (PAHs) that penetrated the reacted layer at PAH concentrations in the range of 0.2-10 mg L-1. The effective particle diffusion coefficients (Deff) derived from the two models were determined from the batch rate data. The Weber and Morris intraparticle diffusion model made a double contribution to the surface and pore diffusivities in the sorption process. The Deff values derived from both the HPMD and SPM equations varied from 1.1 ?? 10-13 to 6.0 ?? 10-14 m2 s-1. The simplest model, the pore diffusion model, was applied first for data analysis. The model of the next level of complexity, the surface diffusion model, was applied in order to gain a deeper understanding of the diffusion process. This model is able to explain the data, and the apparent surface diffusivities are in the same order of magnitude as the values for the sorption of functionalized aromatic hydrocarbons (phenols and sulphonates) that are described in the literature. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Viable counts increased 4.6-fold and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) biodegradation increased 57\% in the presence of Igepal CO-630, a nonylphenol ethoxylate (HLB 13, 0.625 g/L). Only the nonylphenol ethoxylate with an HLB value of 13 substantially enhanced biodegradation. The surfactants from other chemical classes with HLB values of 13 (0.625 g/L) had no effect or were inhibitory. TPH biodegradation enhancement by Igepal CO-630 occurred at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. When the effect of surfactant on individual oil fractions was examined, the biodegradation enhancement for the saturate and aromatic fractions was the same. In all cases, biodegradation resulted in increased resin and asphaltene concentrations. Optimal surfactant concentrations for TPH biodegradation reduced resin and asphaltene formation. Chemical surfactants have the potential to improve crude oil biodegradation in complex microbial systems, and surfactant selection should consider factors such as molecular structure, HLB, and surfactant concentration.},

  abstract = {Surfactants, both chemical and biological, are amphiphilic compounds which can reduce surface and interfacial tensions by accumulating at the interface of immiscible fluids and increase the solubility, mobility, bioavailability and subsequent biodegradation of hydrophobic or insoluble organic compounds. Investigations on their impacts on microbial activity have generally been limited in scope to the most common and best characterized surfactants. Recently a number of new biosurfactants have been described and accelerated advances in molecular and cellular biology are expected to expand our insights into the diversity of structures and applications of biosurfactants. Biosurfactants play an essential natural role in the swarming motility of microorganisms and participate in cellular physiological processes of signaling and differentiation as well as in biofilm formation. Biosurfactants also exhibit natural physiological roles in increasing bioavailability of hydrophobic molecules and can complex with heavy metals, and some also possess antimicrobial activity. Chemical- and indeed bio-surfactants may also be added exogenously to microbial systems to influence behaviour and/or activity, mimicking the latter effects of biosurfactants. They have been exploited in this way, for example as antimicrobial agents in disease control and to improve degradation of chemical contaminants. Chemical surfactants can interact with microbial proteins and can be manipulated to modify enzyme conformation in a manner that alters enzyme activity, stability and/or specificity. Both chemical- and bio-surfactants are potentially toxic to specific microbes and may be exploited as antimicrobial agents against plant, animal and human microbial pathogens. Because of the widespread use of chemical surfactants, their potential impacts on microbial communities in the environment are receiving considerable attention. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Bacterial adhesion in natural and artificial systems has been critically reviewed to investigate the influences exerted by the presence of interfaces. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that, in the presence of a solid phase, the activity of bacterial cultures is changed. Reviewing relevant literature, two problems were encountered. One is of an experimental nature. Due to lack of similarity in experimental conditions, disparate experiments often cannot be compared; their results may even appear conflicting. The other problem is of an interpretational nature: several hypothetical theories exist which try to explain the effect of surfaces on microbial activity. These theories often confuse changes in the medium and limitations in mass transfer which are due to the presence of solid surfaces (indirect influences) with changes in cell properties (direct influences). Whenever a surface is reported to influence the metabolism of bacteria, the action is found almost exclusively to be due to changes in the medium or environment and is therefore indirect. Based on data reported in the literature, and by using thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, it is concluded that so far neither experimental nor theoretical evidence exists for a direct influence of interfaces on microbial activity.},

  abstract = {Live-cell imaging has opened an exciting window into the role cellular heterogeneity plays in dynamic, living systems. A major critical challenge for this class of experiments is the problem of image segmentation, or determining which parts of a microscope image correspond to which individual cells. Current approaches require many hours of manual curation and depend on approaches that are difficult to share between labs. They are also unable to robustly segment the cytoplasms of mammalian cells. Here, we show that deep convolutional neural networks, a supervised machine learning method, can solve this challenge for multiple cell types across the domains of life. We demonstrate that this approach can robustly segment fluorescent images of cell nuclei as well as phase images of the cytoplasms of individual bacterial and mammalian cells from phase contrast images without the need for a fluorescent cytoplasmic marker. These networks also enable the simultaneous segmentation and identification of different mammalian cell types grown in co-culture. A quantitative comparison with prior methods demonstrates that convolutional neural networks have improved accuracy and lead to a significant reduction in curation time. We relay our experience in designing and optimizing deep convolutional neural networks for this task and outline several design rules that we found led to robust performance. We conclude that deep convolutional neural networks are an accurate method that require less curation time, are generalizable to a multiplicity of cell types, from bacteria to mammalian cells, and expand live-cell imaging capabilities to include multi-cell type systems.},

In order to discover regulatory factors involved in HL acclimation in cyanobacteria, a screen was performed for chemically generated mutants unable to properly control expression of the hlia gene in response to HL. One such mutant was identified, and complementation analysis led to the identification of the affected gene, designated nblS. Based on its deduced protein sequence, NBIS appears to be a membrane-bound, PAS-domain-bearing, sensor histidine kinase of two-component regulatory systems in bacteria. The nblS mutant was unable to properly control light intensity-mediated expression of several other photosynthesis-related genes, including all three psbA genes and the cpcBA genes. The mutant was also unable to control expression of the hliA and psba genes in response to low-intensity blue/UV-A light, a response that may be related to the HL-mediated regulation of the genes. Additionally, in response to nutrient deprivation, the nblS mutant was unable to properly control accumulation of the nbL4 transcript and associated degradation of the light-harvesting phycobilisomes. The nblS mutant dies more rapidly than wild-type cells following exposure to HL or nutrient deprivation, likely due to its inability to properly acclimate to these stress conditions. Thus, the NBIS protein is involved in the control of a number of processes critical for altering the photosynthetic apparatus in response to both HL and nutrient stress conditions.},

We have studied the diffusion mechanisms of drugs with different water solubilities through this hydrogel. A water-soluble model drug (aminopyrine) was used to study the diffusion coefficient changes in different pHs. The results showed a water-content dependent diffusion for this pH-sensitive polycationic hydrogel. However, decreasing the solubility of the drug and increasing the hydrophobic character of the polymer by changing the pH caused a greater affinity (or partition coefficient) between the hydrogel and the drug. Aminopyrine diffusion was shown to follow the free-volume theory, suggesting the 'pore' type mechanism for water soluble drugs, while the 'partition' or 'solution-diffusion' mechanism better described the slow diffusion of water insoluble solutes through this pH-sensitive hydrogel. Comparing the swelling interface number for aminopyrine release through this pH-sensitive hydrogel showed a non-Fickian mechanism in the hydrated form of the hydrogel (pH 1.2), while Fickian in the dehydrated form (pH 7.4).},

The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.},

  abstract = {The toxicity of homologous series of organic solvents has been investigated for the gram-positive bacteria, Arthrobacter sp. and Nocardia sp., and the gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp. The hydrophobicity of the solvent, expressed by its logP(octanol), proves to be a good measure for the toxicity of solvents in a two-phase system. The transition from toxic to nontoxic solvents occurs between logP(octanol) 3 and 5 and depends on the homologous series. No correlation has been found between the hydrophobicity of the substituent on the alkyl backbone of the solvent and the location of the transition point in toxicity. The logP(octanol), above which all solvents are nontoxic, is used to express the solvent tolerance of the bacteria. In general, the solvent tolerance of gram-negative bacteria is found to be slightly higher than that of gram-positive bacteria, but this does not hold for all homologous series of organic solvents investigated.Because the toxicity effects of organic solvents in a two-phase system can be ascribed to molecular as well as phase toxicity effects, molecular toxicity effects were investigated separately in a one-phase system with subsaturating amounts of organic solvent. The solvent concentration in the aqueous phase, at which 50\% of the metabolic activity of the bacteria is lost, is used to express solvent toxicity. This concentration is found to be similar for the gram-positive Arthrobacter and the gram-negative Acinetobacter. Assuming the critical membrane concentration theory (G. J. Osborne et al. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1990, 12: 281-291) to be valid, it can be concluded that differences in solvent tolerance between these two bacteria, cannot be ascribed to differences in response to molecular toxicity. Prediction of the toxicity of any solvent, using the critical membrane theory, appears to be possible in the case of alkanols or alkyl acetates. However, prediction of the toxicity of ethers appears to be impossible.},

New sieving equations are derived to calculate r and A(p)/Deltax (respectively, the pore radius and the total area of the pores per unit of path length). These equations provide a better agreement than the older formulas between the calculated and the experimental glomerular sieving coefficients for [(125)I]polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) fractions with a mean equivalent radius between 19 and 37 A. From r and A(p)/Deltax, the mean effective glomerular filtration pressure has been calculated, applying Poiseuille's law. A value of 15.4 mm Hg has been derived from the mean sieving curve obtained from 23 experiments performed on normal anesthetized dogs.},

These three systems were fed groundwater contaminated with benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). The breakthrough profiles, steady-state removal of BTX and system responses to step increases in applied organic loading rates were investigated. During start-up, even though the same amount of inoculum was added to the two biological systems, the time required until effective biodegradation commenced in the system employing GAC as a biomass carrier was less than that observed for the system using non-activated carbon (200 vs 500 h). Significantly less BTX was released during this period by the system with combined removal mechanisms and the development of a contiguous biofilm was more rapid. Under constant, steady state, organic loading conditions (3 and 6 kg-COD/m3-day), BTX removals were similar for the two biological systems, although the system employing the GAC carrier had lower effluent concentrations at the lower loading rate. More than 90\% of the BTX were removed in both systems. During step increases in organic loading, however, the combination of biological and adsorptive removal capacity resulted in enhanced BTX removal and more stable operation. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the extent of surface coverage of the GAC and non-activated carbon by the biofilm. Particles from both systems were observed to be completely covered by a contiguous, thick biofilm. ?? 1992.},

Cells were incubated with the weak base 3-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-3'-amino-N-methylpropylamine (DAMP) followed by immunocytochemical localization in whole cells and on ultrathin sections. After resupplying silicate to cells synchronized by silicon depletion, the uptake of this nutrient from the medium was the same with or without DAMP; new valves developed without morphological aberrations that could conceivably have been caused by the probe. DAMP was found in cellular compartments known to be acidic, such as vacuoles active as lysosomes, the lumen of thylakoids, and microbodies. In the nucleus and mitochondria, which are circumneutral and basic compartments, the probe did not appear. Besides its presence in acidic compartments, DAMP was specifically accumulated within the SDV during formation of new valves; during the process of valve maturation, the SDV seemed to become increasingly acidic. In control experiments using the ionophores chloroquine, valinomycin, and nigericin, the compartmental location of DAMP was clearly disturbed, resulting in a random intracellular distribution. Accumulation of the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123, which can be translocated over membranes by a reducing potential, confirmed that the SDV can translocate weak bases. The results with DAMP suggest that the pH of the SDV is important in the silicification of diatoms: It facilitates a fast nucleation and aggregation of silica particles, thus increasing the rate of formation of the mature frustules. In addition, the acidic environment might protect the newly formed valves against dissolution before completion and coverage by the organic casing prior to their secretion.},

  abstract = {Toluene dioxygenase, a multicomponent enzyme system known to oxidize mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons to cis-dihydrodiols, oxidized indene and indan to 1-indenol and 1-indanol, respectively. In addition, the enzyme catalyzed dioxygen addition to the nonaromatic double bond of indene to form cis-1,2-indandiol. The oxygen atoms in 1-indenol and cis-1,2-indandiol were shown to be derived from molecular oxygen, whereas 70\% of the oxygen in 1-indanol was derived from water. All of the isolated products were optically active as demonstrated by 19F NMR and HPLC discrimination of diastereomeric esters and by chiroptic methods. The high optical purity of (-)-(1R)-indanol (84\% enantiomeric excess) and the failure of scavengers of reactive oxygen species to inhibit the monooxygenation reaction supported the contention that the monooxygen insertion is mediated by an active-site process. Experiments with 3-[2H]indene indicated that equilibration between C-1 and C-3 occurred prior to the formation of the carbon-oxygen bond to yield 1-indenol. Naphthalene dioxygenase also oxidized indan to 1-indanol, which suggested that benzylic monoxygenation may be typical of this group of dioxygenases.},

  abstract = {s-Triazine ring compounds are common industrial chemicals: pesticides, resin intermediates, dyes, and explosives. The fate of these compounds in the environment is directly correlated with the ability of microbes to metabolize them. Microbes metabolize melamine and the triazine herbicides such as atrazine via enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. Hydrolytic removal of substituents on the s-triazine ring is catalyzed by enzymes from the amidohydrolase superfamily and yields cyanuric acid as an intermediate. Cyanuric acid is hydrolytically processed to yield 3 mol each of ammonia and carbon dioxide. In those cases studied, the genes underlying the hydrolytic reactions are localized to large catabolic plasmids. One such plasmid, pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. ADP, has been completely sequenced and contains the genes for atrazine catabolism. Insertion sequence elements play a role in constructing different atrazine catabolic plasmids in different bacteria. Atrazine chlorohydrolase has been purified to homogeneity from two sources. Recombinant Escherichia coli strains expressing atrazine chlorohydrolase have been constructed and chemically cross-linked to generate catalytic particles used for atrazine remediation in soil. The method was used for cleaning up a spill of 1,000 pounds of atrazine to attain a level of herbicide acceptable to regulatory agencies.},

  abstract = {Cooperation via production of common goods is found in diverse life forms ranging from viruses to social animals. However, natural selection predicts a "tragedy of the commons": Cheaters, benefiting from without producing costly common goods, are more fit than cooperators and should destroy cooperation. In an attempt to discover novel mechanisms of cheater control, we eliminated known ones using a yeast cooperator-cheater system engineered to supply or exploit essential nutrients. Surprisingly, although less fit than cheaters, cooperators quickly dominated a fraction of cocultures. Cooperators isolated from these cocultures were superior to the cheater isolates they had been cocultured with, even though these cheaters were superior to ancestral cooperators. Resequencing and phenotypic analyses revealed that evolved cooperators and cheaters all harbored mutations adaptive to the nutrient-limited cooperative environment, allowing growth at a much lower concentration of nutrient than their ancestors. Even after the initial round of adaptation, evolved cooperators still stochastically dominated cheaters derived from them. We propose the "adaptive race" model: If during adaptation to an environment, the fitness gain of cooperators exceeds that of cheaters by at least the fitness cost of cooperation, the tragedy of the commons can be averted. Although cooperators and cheaters sample from the same pool of adaptive mutations, this symmetry is soon broken: The best cooperators purge cheaters and continue to grow, whereas the best cheaters cause rapid self-extinction. We speculate that adaptation to changing environments may contribute to the persistence of cooperative systems before the appearance of more sophisticated mechanisms of cheater control.},

The diffusion coefficients corresponding to these two modes differ by an order of magnitude, and both modes are also observed on chemically homogeneous surfaces.

We have carried out extensive proteomic studies to quantify heat-triggered aggregation and subsequent disaggregation in budding yeast, identifying {$>$}170 endogenous proteins aggregating within minutes of heat shock in multiple subcellular compartments. We demonstrate that these aggregated proteins are not misfolded and destined for degradation. Stable-isotope labeling reveals that even severely aggregated endogenous proteins are disaggregated without degradation during recovery from shock, contrasting with the rapid degradation observed for many exogenous thermolabile proteins. Although aggregation likely inactivates many cellular proteins, in the case of a heterotrimeric aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex, the aggregated proteins remain active with unaltered fidelity. We propose that most heat-induced aggregation of mature proteins reflects the operation of an adaptive, autoregulatory process of functionally significant aggregate assembly and disassembly that aids cellular adaptation to thermal stress.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to examine the role of molecular structure in determining the biodegradation rates of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Laboratory experiments were performed in aqueous systems, and data were analyzed in a manner that allowed determination of first-order biodegradation rates independent of bioavailability limitations from physical-chemical processes. An aerobic mixed culture was used, which had been enriched on a broad range of PAHs. The 22 PAHs included in this study ranged in size from two to four rings and included compounds with 5-carbon rings and alkyl substituents. The range of observed biodegradation rates was only 1 order of magnitude, which is much less than that which is typically observed in the field. This supports the findings of other types of studies, which conclude that most of the observed variation in environmental PAH biodegradation rates comes from processes controlling the bioavailability of the compounds and not processes controlling uptake or biotransformation. Rate differences that were observed were attributable either to the presence of a 5-carbon ring or an alkyl substituent in an alpha position. Various molecular descriptors that might be expected to correlate with rate-limiting steps in the biodegradation process were used in an attemptto develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship for the PAH biodegradation rates. No significant correlations were found, but rate limitation from interactions with the relevant enzymes remains a possibility.},

  abstract = {The layer-by-layer (LbL) templating technique has attracted significant interest as a simple, highly versatile approach that has been widely used to prepare nanostructured materials with tailored properties. The process involves the sequential deposition of species, such as polymers, nanoparticles, lipids, proteins, and dye molecules, onto various templates, which are subsequently removed to yield free-standing structures. Although fine control of the material properties (e.g., size, composition, thickness, permeability, function) is afforded by the type of species LbL-assembled, the morphology and composition of the templates also play a crucial role in determining the properties, and hence potential applications, of the materials generated. In this review, we focus on the two main classes of templates that have been employed to prepare nanostructured materials: planar and colloidal. The use of porous planar and colloidal substrates in LbL templating synthesis is also presented, as this offers opportunities to fabricate novel materials with advanced structuring. Particular emphasis will be placed on using colloidal templates of different composition (e.g., polymer, inorganic, liquid droplets, gas bubbles) and geometry (e.g., spheres, rods, fibers). The assembly routes employed to prepare a range of nanostructured materials, including films, capsules, nanotubes, nanoporous particles, and macroporous and biomimetic structures, are described, together with the potential applications of the materials in fields such as adsorption/immobilization, catalysis, drug delivery, sensing, separations, and synthesis. Future research directions of the LbL templating technique are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Many unicellular organisms take their outer proteinaceous and lipidic membranes or carbonhydrate-rich cell walls as a template for biomineralization to synthesize a thin mineral layer as a functional covering. In nature most cells cannot be mineralized spontaneously in the normal states. Inspired by nature, we develop cytocompatible methods for cells encapsulated inside a mineral shell, called "cellular shellization." Using Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly, the precipitation of calcium minerals can be induced on the yeast cell surfaces. The effects of different synthetic polyelectrolytes on the calcifications of yeast, such as interfacial energy, zeta-potential, introduction time, and the affinity of mineral phase on the yeast cell surface have been studied by using constant composition method (CC) systemically and quantitatively. The results demonstrate that the effective adsorption of polyelectrolytes with carboxyl or sulfonate-rich groups on the yeast can enhance mineralization abilities of yeast cells readily, and the factor of interfacial energy plays a key role in the superficial mineralization of the cells. Furthermore, the influences of ion concentrations, as well as titration rates on the formation of inorganic shell, have also been examined. It is found that the biomimetic shell formation on the cell can also be achieved by using an appropriate selection of titration conditions rather than the pretreatment of LbL. Thus, the control of cellular biomineralization can become more feasible. In this study, we show that adjusting the interfacial energy is the key to cellular mineralization and suggest that these biomineralization treatments of single-cell may be applied as a potential and universal approach for cell-based sensing and therapy.

  abstract = {Road information is fundamental not only in the military field but also common daily living. Automatic road extraction from a remote sensing images can provide references for city planning as well as transportation database and map updating. However, owing to the spectral similarity between roads and impervious structures, the current methods solely using spectral characteristics are often ineffective. By contrast, the detailed information discernible from the high-resolution aerial images enables road extraction with spatial texture features. In this study, a knowledge-based method is established and proposed; this method incorporates the spatial texture feature into urban road extraction. The spatial texture feature is initially extracted by the local Moran’s I, and the derived texture is added to the spectral bands of image for image segmentation. Subsequently, features like brightness, standard deviation, rectangularity, aspect ratio, and area are selected to form the hypothesis and verification model based on road knowledge. Finally, roads are extracted by applying the hypothesis and verification model and are post-processed based on the mathematical morphology. The newly proposed method is evaluated by conducting two experiments. Results show that the completeness, correctness, and quality of the results could reach approximately 94\%, 90\% and 86\% respectively, indicating that the proposed method is effective for urban road extraction.},

  abstract = {The tubulin homolog FtsZ is the major cytoskeletal protein in the bacterial cell division machinery, conserved in almost all bacteria, archaea, and chloroplasts. Bacterial FtsZ assembles spontaneously into single protofilaments, sheets, and bundles in vitro, and it also accumulates at the site of division early during cell division, where it forms a dynamic protein complex, the contractile ring or Z-ring. The biochemical properties of FtsZ proteins from many bacteria have been studied, but comparable insights into FtsZs from cyanobacteria are limited. Here, using EM and light-scattering assays, we studied the biochemical and assembly properties of SyFtsZ, the FtsZ protein from the cyanobacterial strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. SyFtsZ had a slow GTPase activity of -0.4 GTP/FtsZ molecule/min and assembled into thick, straight protofilament bundles and curved bundles, designated toroids. The assembly of SyFtsZ in the presence of GTP occurred in two stages. The first stage consisted of the assembly of single-stranded straight protofilaments and opened circles; in the second stage, the protofilaments associated into straight protofilament bundles and toroids. In addition to these assemblies, we also observed highly curved oligomers and minirings after GTP hydrolysis or in the presence of excess GDP. The three types of protofilaments of SyFtsZ observed here provide support for the hypothesis that a constriction force due to curved protofilaments bends the membrane. In summary, our findings indicate that, unlike other bacterial FtsZ, SyFtsZ assembles into thick protofilament bundles. This bundling is similar to that of chloroplast FtsZ, consistent with its origin in cyanobacteria.},

Homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase (HPCD) catalyzes the key ring cleavage step in the metabolism of hpca by the Gram (+) bacterium Brevibacterium fuscum to yield α-hydroxy-δ-carboxymethyl cis-muconic semialdehyde. A genomic DNA library of B. fuscum was constructed in Escherichia coli using a cosmid vector and screened by spraying the cells with hpca. One clone was found to contain the gene for HPCD based on its ability to convert hpca into the yellow-colored product. This cosmid clone was further subcloned and the gene for HPCD was localized and sequenced. The open reading frame codes for a protein with 365 amino acids and M(r) = 41,699, in accord with the characteristics of the previously purified wild-type enzyme. The gene for HPCD was overexpressed in E. coli to \textasciitilde 30\% of the total soluble protein, and purification of the recombinant enzyme to apparent homogeneity was achieved by a two-step procedure. Iron was the only abundant metal found in the purified recombinant enzyme, and the specific activity per iron was comparable to that observed for the wild-type enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence of HPCD has a very high level of homology (78.6\% identity in the 337-aa overlap) to the manganese-dependent homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase (MndD) from Arthrobacter globiformis CM-2. The basis for the difference in metal selection by HPCD and MndD was investigated by mutagenesis of a 50-base-pair region of the HPCD gene containing three frame shifts relative to the MndD gene. The purified triple mutant of HPCD did not exhibit a significant change in the metal content; therefore, other factors must contribute to the selection of the active site metal.},

  abstract = {Modular and orthogonal genetic logic gates are essential for building robust biologically based digital devices to customize cell signalling in synthetic biology. Here we constructed an orthogonal AND gate in Escherichia coli using a novel hetero-regulation module from Pseudomonas syringae. The device comprises two co-activating genes hrpR and hrpS controlled by separate promoter inputs, and a 54 -dependent hrpL promoter driving the output. The hrpL promoter is activated only when both genes are expressed, generating digital-like AND integration behaviour. The AND gate is demonstrated to be modular by applying new regulated promoters to the inputs, and connecting the output to a NOT gate module to produce a combinatorial NAND gate. The circuits were assembled using a parts-based engineering approach of quantitative characterization, modelling, followed by construction and testing. The results show that new genetic logic devices can be engineered predictably from novel native orthogonal biological control elements using quantitatively in-context characterized parts. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Cyanobacteria are equipped with efficient carbon fixation mechanism, and are ideal cell factories to produce various fuel and chemical products. Past efforts to produce terpenes in photosynthetic organisms have gained only limited success. Here we engineered the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to efficiently produce limonene through modeling guided study. Computational modeling of limonene flux in response to photosynthetic output has revealed the downstream terpene synthase as a key metabolic flux-controlling node in the MEP (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate) pathway-derived terpene biosynthesis. By enhancing the downstream limonene carbon sink, we achieved over 100-fold increase in limonene productivity, in contrast to the marginal increase achieved through stepwise metabolic engineering. The establishment of a strong limonene flux revealed potential synergy between photosynthate output and terpene biosynthesis, leading to enhanced carbon flux into the MEP pathway. Moreover, we show that enhanced limonene flux would lead to NADPH accumulation, and slow down photosynthesis electron flow. Fine-tuning ATP/NADPH toward terpene biosynthesis could be a key parameter to adapt photosynthesis to support biofuel/bioproduct production in cyanobacteria.},

Two grand technical challenges, however, impede further development of the field. Fixed cell-based approaches can provide snapshots of high-dimensional expression profiles but have fundamental limits on revealing temporal information, and fluorescence-based live-cell imaging approaches provide temporal information but are technically challenging for multiplex long-term imaging. We first developed a live-cell imaging platform that tracks cellular status change through combining endogenous fluorescent labeling that minimizes perturbation to cell physiology and/or live-cell imaging of high-dimensional cell morphological and texture features. With our platform and an A549 VIM-RFP epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) reporter cell line, live-cell trajectories reveal parallel paths of EMT missing from snapshot data due to cell-cell dynamic heterogeneity. Our results emphasize the necessity of extracting dynamical information of phenotypic transitions from multiplex live-cell imaging.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of bacterial cell size control is based mainly on stress-free growth conditions in the laboratory [1–10]. In the real world, however, bacteria are routinely faced with stresses that produce long filamentous cell morphologies [11–28]. Escherichia coli is observed to filament in response to DNA damage [22–25], antibiotic treatment [11–14, 28], host immune systems [15, 16], temperature [17], starvation [20], and more [18, 19, 21], conditions which are relevant to clinical settings and food preservation [26]. This shape plasticity is considered a survival strategy [27]. Size control in this regime remains largely unexplored. Here we report that E. coli cells use a dynamic size ruler to determine division locations combined with an adder-like mechanism to trigger divisions. As filamentous cells increase in size due to growth, or decrease in size due to divisions, its multiple Fts division rings abruptly reorganize to remain one characteristic cell length away from the cell pole and two such length units away from each other. These rules can be explained by spatiotemporal oscillations of Min proteins. Upon removal of filamentation stress, the cells undergo a sequence of division events, randomly at one of the possible division sites, on average after the time required to grow one characteristic cell size. These results indicate that E. coli cells continuously keep track of absolute length to control size, suggest a wider relevance for the adder principle beyond the control of normally sized cells, and provide a new perspective on the function of the Fts and Min systems. Wehrens, Ershov, et al. report a new size-control mechanism in E. coli cells that have elongated due to stress. Multiple division rings are continuously rearranged in response to growth and division to control daughter cell size when divisions resume. Divisions are spatially controlled by the Min system and temporally by the adder principle.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the use of micropatterned agarose stamps prepared by molding against PDMS masters to print patterns of bacteria on agar plates. Topographically patterned agarose stamps were inked with suspensions of bacteria; these stamps generated patterns of bacteria with features as small as 200 microm over areas as large as 50 cm2. Stamps with many small features ({$>$}200 microm) were used to study patterns of bacteria growing on media containing gradients of small molecules; stamps with larger features ({$>$}750 microm) were used to print different strains of bacteria simultaneously. The stamp transfers only a small percentage of cells that are on its surface to the agar at a time; it is thus possible to replica-pattern hundreds of times with a single inking. The use of soft stamps provides other useful functions. Stamps are easily customized to provide a range of patterns. When culture media is included in the agarose stamp, cells divide and thrive on the surface. The resulting "living stamp" regenerates its "ink" and can be used to pattern surfaces repetitively for a month. This method is rapid, reproducible, convenient, and can be used to control the pattern, spacing, and orientation between colonies of different bacteria.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs are faced with almost complete destruction by the end of the century due to global warming unless humanity can cap global temperature rise. There is now a race to develop a diverse set of solutions to save coral reefs. In this perspective, a case is made for understanding the cell biology of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis to help inform development of solutions for saving reefs. Laboratory model systems for the study of coral symbiosis, including the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida, are featured as valuable tools in the fight to save corals. The roles of host innate immunity and inter-partner nutrient dynamics in the onset, ongoing maintenance, and dysregulation of symbiosis are reviewed and discussed. Key innate immune genes and pathways, such as glycan-lectin interactions, the sphingosine rheostat, and the cytokine transforming growth factor beta are shown to modulate a host immune response in the symbiotic state. An upset in the homeostatic inorganic nutrient balance during heat stress and high exogenous nutrient availability is credited with driving the partnership toward dysregulation and coral bleaching. Specific examples are given where knowledge of the cell biology of symbiosis is informing the development of solutions, including studies showing clear limitations in the value of partner switching and acclimatization protocols. Finally, emphasis is placed on rapid advancement of knowledge to try to meet the urgent need for solutions. This includes real-time open communication with colleagues on successes and failures, sharing of resources and information, and working together in the spirit of a collective mission to save coral reefs.},

In multicellular cyanobacteria, septal junctions enable molecular exchange between sister cells and are required for cellular differentiation. The structure of septal junctions is poorly understood, and it is unknown whether they are capable of controlling intercellular communication. Here, we resolved the in situ architecture of septal junctions by electron cryotomography of cryo-focused ion beam-milled cyanobacterial filaments. Septal junctions consisted of a tube traversing the septal peptidoglycan. Each tube end comprised a FraD-containing plug, which was covered by a cytoplasmic cap. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that intercellular communication was blocked upon stress. Gating was accompanied by a reversible conformational change of the septal junction cap. We provide the mechanistic framework for a cell junction that predates eukaryotic gap junctions by a billion years. The conservation of a gated dynamic mechanism across different domains of life emphasizes the importance of controlling molecular exchange in multicellular organisms. The in situ architecture of cyanobacterial septal junctions reveals a gated intercellular communication channel that evolutionarily predates eukaryotic gap junctions by a billion years.},

  abstract = {We previously reported that Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, engineered with the sucrose transporter CscB, can export up to 85\% of its photosynthetically-fixed carbon as sucrose and shows considerable promise as an alternative carbohydrate source. One approach to effectively utilize this cyanobacterium is to generate synthetic, light-driven consortia in which sucrose-metabolizing heterotrophs catalyze the conversion of the low-value carbohydrate into higher-value compounds in co-culture. Here, we report an improved synthetic photoautotroph/chemoheterotroph consortial design in which sucrose secreted by S. elongatus CscB directly supports the bacterium Halomonas boliviensis, a natural producer of the bioplastic precursor, PHB. We show that alginate encapsulation of S. elongatus CscB enhances sucrose-export rates \textasciitilde 2-fold within 66 h, to \textasciitilde 290 mg sucrose L−1 d−1 OD750−1 and enhances the co-culture stability. Consortial H. boliviensis accumulate up to 31\% of their dry-weight as PHB, reaching productivities up to 28.3 mg PHB L−1 d−1. This light-driven, alginate-partitioned co-culture platform achieves PHB productivities that match or exceed those of traditionally engineered cyanobacterial monocultures. Importantly, S. elongatus CscB/H. boliviensis co-cultures were continuously productive for over 5 months and resisted invasive microbial species without the application of antibiotics or other chemical selection agents.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial organization of the gut microbiota is important for understanding the physical andmolecular interactions among its members. These interactions are thought to influence microbial succession, community stability, syntrophic relationships, and resiliency in the face of perturbations. The complexity and dynamism of the gut microbiota pose considerable challenges for quantitative analysis of its spatial organization. Here, we illustrate an approach for addressing this challenge, using (i) a model, defined 15-member consortium of phylogenetically diverse, sequenced human gut bacterial strains introduced into adult gnotobiotic mice fed a polysaccharide-rich diet, and (ii) in situ hybridization and spectral imaging analysis methods that allow simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial strains at multiple spatial scales. Differences in the binding affinities of strains for substrates such as mucus or food particles, combined with more rapid replication in a preferred microhabitat, could, in principle, lead to localized clonally expanded aggregates composed of one or a few taxa. However, our results reveal a colonic community that is mixed at micrometer scales, with distinct spatial distributions of some taxa relative to one another, notably at the border between the mucosa and the lumen. Our data suggest that lumen and mucosa in the proximal colon should be conceptualized not as stratified compartments but as components of an incompletely mixed bioreactor. Employing the experimental approaches described should allow direct tests of whether and how specified host and microbial factors influence the nature and functional contributions of "microscale" mixing to the dynamic operations of the microbiota in health and disease.},

  abstract = {In recent years ever-increasing amounts of pharmaceuticals are being detected in the aquatic environment and in some cases, they have even been discovered in drinking water. Their presence is attributed mainly to the inability of sewage treatment plants to adequately remove these compounds from the sewage influent. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, kinetics and efficiency of using liquid-core microcapsules as a novel methodology, termed capsular perstraction, to remove seven pharmaceuticals commonly found in the environment, from water. The process involves the envelopment of pre-selected organic solvents within a porous hydrogel membrane to form liquid-core microcapsules, which can be used to extract a large range of compounds. Results indicate that this novel approach is capable of extracting the seven chosen compounds rapidly and with a variable efficiency. The simultaneous use of both dibutyl sebacate and oleic acid liquid-core microcapsules at a liquid volume ratio of only 4\% (v/v) resulted in the following extractions within 50 min of capsule addition to contaminated water: furosemide 15\%; clofibric acid 19\%; sulfamethoxazole 22\%; carbamazepine 54\%; warfarin 80\%; metoprolol 90\% and diclofenac 100\%. The effects of different agitation rates, microcapsule size and membrane thickness on the rate of mass transfer of warfarin into the liquid-core (dibutyl sebacate) of microcapsules was also examined. Results showed that the main rate-limiting step to mass transfer was due to the stagnant organic film (microcapsule size) within the core of the microcapsules. A volumetric mass transfer coefficient of 2.28 ?? 10-6 m/s was obtained for the smallest microcapsules, which was nearly 4-fold higher compared to the value (0.6 ?? 10-6 m/s) obtained for the largest microcapsules used in this study. Even with this resistance liquid-core microcapsules are still capable of the rapid extraction of the tested compounds and may provide a platform for the safe disposal of the pharmaceuticals after removal. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {It has become increasingly and widely recognised that bacteria do not exist as solitary cells, but are colonial organisms that exploit elaborate systems of intercellular communication to facilitate their adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The languages by which bacteria communicate take the form of chemical signals, excreted from the cells, which can elicit profound physiological changes. Many types of signalling molecules, which regulate diverse phenotypes across distant genera, have been described. The most common signalling molecules found in Gram-negative bacteria are N-acyl derivatives of homoserine lactone (acyl HSLs). Modulation of the physiological processes controlled by acyl HSLs (and, indeed, many of the non-acyl HSL-mediated systems) occurs in a cell density- and growth phase-dependent manner. Therefore, the term 'quorum-sensing' has been coined to describe this ability of bacteria to monitor cell density before expressing a phenotype. In this paper, we review the current state of research concerning acyl HSL-mediated quorum-sensing. We also describe two non-acyl HSL-based systems utilised by the phytopathogens Ralstonia solanacearum and Xanthomonas campestris. ?? 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

We further show that the search takes less than 9\,±\,3\,min (mean~±~s.d)~and is mediated by a thin, highly dynamic RecA filament that stretches throughout the cell. We propose that the architecture of the RecA filament effectively reduces search dimensionality. This model predicts a search time that is consistent with our measurement and is corroborated by the observation that the search time does not depend on the length of the cell or the amount of DNA. Given the abundance of RecA homologues \textsuperscript{5} , we believe this model to be~widely conserved across living organisms. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the last decade, many developments in this new field have been introduced. The technology has evolved from fixed cell analysis towards living single-cell dynamic systems’ biology and high content analyses. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of the developments of living cellular microarrays in microfluidic bioreactors. Cell arrays in microfluidic bioreactors constructed with adherent mammalian cells are compared to \textbackslash r\textbackslash nnon-adherent cells (mainly microbial cells). An overview is given on the design and construction of these microfluidic devices with a particular focus on cell patterning techniques. Cell patterning on adhesive micropatterns using techniques such as microcontact printing, microfluidic patterning, dip-pen nanolithography and polymer pen lithography as well as photo-patterning and laser-patterning strategies are discussed. Additionally, developments in mechanical cell patterning methods and robotic cell printing are reviewed. Two-dimensional (2D) as well as recently developed 3D cell arraying are discussed. Finally, cell array microfluidic setups and operation for single-cell types versus cell population variants are illustrated and compared on the basis of some illustrative examples in the field of drug screening, cytotoxicity evaluation, and basic cellular and microbiology research.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that a large fraction of marine bacterioplankton are either dead or moribund and, therefore, new methods are required to distinguish bacteria of different physiological states. A method is described which uses the general cell stain 4'6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), the vital stain propidium iodide (PI), and 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes, to quantitatively identify cells with compromised membranes, and those cells containing sufficient rRNA to be considered metabolically active. Validation and optimization of this method was conducted using cultured bacteria. Optimal PI staining was achieved after cells were washed in 10 mM MgSO4 (pH=6.5) and stained with PI (5 μg/ml) for 30 min. Staining of cells with PI appeared to be independent of growth phase and cells could be stored in 25\% (v/v) glycerol for at least one month at -20°C without changes in staining status. Staining of heat-killed cells indicated that PI stained only dead cells. Comparison of PI staining properties and hybridization with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes indicated that there was a strong inverse correlation between hybridization of cells with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes and cells stained by PI. Evidence indicates that this vital stain and probe (VSP) technique differentiates between (1) cells that are dead, (2) cells that are dead but were recently active ({$<$}36 h), (3) cells that are living and (4) cells that are inactive but not dead. The VSP protocol comprises a powerful tool to investigate the relative importance of these cell types in situ, and how they change in response to environmental factors.

However, they are expected to guide the succession of community development and function toward specific outcomes that could impact human health and the environment. In this study, we put forward a combined experimental and agent-based modeling framework and use it to interpret unique spatial organization patterns of H1-Type VI secretion system (T6SS) mutants of P. aeruginosa under spatial confinement. We find that key parameters, such as T6SS-mediated cell contact and lysis, spatial localization, relative species abundance, cell density and local concentrations of growth substrates and metabolites are influenced by spatial confinement. The model, written in the accessible programming language NetLogo, can be adapted to a variety of biological systems of interest and used to simulate experiments across a broad parameter space. It was implemented and run in a high-throughput mode by deploying it across multiple CPUs, with each simulation representing an individual well within a high-throughput microwell array experimental platform. The microfluidics and agent-based modeling framework we present in this paper provides an effective means by which to connect experimental studies in microbiology to model development. The work demonstrates progress in coupling experimental results to simulation while also highlighting potential sources of discrepancies between real-world experiments and idealized models.},

The range of environments that they inhabit can be attributed in part to their ability to sense and respond to changing environmental conditions. As photosynthetic organisms, one of the most crucial parameters for cyanobacteria to monitor is light. Cyanobacteria can sense various wavelengths of light and many possess a range of bilin-binding photoreceptors belonging to the phytochrome superfamily. Vital cellular processes including growth, phototaxis, cell aggregation and photosynthesis are tuned to environmental light conditions by these photoreceptors. In this Review, we examine the physiological responses that are controlled by members of this diverse family of photoreceptors and discuss the signal transduction pathways through which these photoreceptors operate. We highlight specific examples where the activities of multiple photoreceptors function together to fine-tune light responses. We also discuss the potential application of these photosensing systems in optogenetics and synthetic biology.},

KaiC is proposed as a negative regulator of the circadian expression of all genes in the genome, and its phosphorylation is regulated positively by KaiA and negatively by KaiB and shows a circadian rhythm in vivo. To study the functions of KaiC phosphorylation in the circadian clock system, we identified two autophosphorylation sites, Ser-431 and Thr-432, by using mass spectrometry (MS). We generated Synechococcus mutants in which these residues were substituted for alanine by using site-directed mutagenesis. Phosphorylation of KaiC was reduced in the single mutants and was completely abolished in the double mutant, indicating that KaiC is also phosphorylated at these sites in vivo. These mutants lost circadian rhythm, indicating that phosphorylation at each of the two sites is essential for the control of the circadian oscillation. Although the nonphosphorylatable mutant KaiC was able to form a hexamer in vitro, it failed to form a clock protein complex with KaiA, KaiB, and SasA in the Synechococcus cells. When nonphosphorylatable KaiC was overexpressed, the kaiBC promoter activity was only transiently repressed. These results suggest that KaiC phosphorylation regulates its transcriptional repression activity by controlling its binding affinity for other clock proteins.},

Asym. Baeyer-Villiger oxidns. by biocatalysts have been established on a large scale with a selectivity not reached by the use of inorg., organometallic, or organocatalysts. Biol. cells make use of the required selectivity in many asym. oxidn. reaction steps of biosynthetic pathways to central and remote metabolites. The elucidation of novel reaction steps in the biosynthesis of known natural products is therefore an interesting entry point for finding the novel biocatalytic reaction methodologies of a wide variety of compds.

These aerogels have porosities ranging from 98\% to 0\%. The mechanical properties of the different aerogels (elastic modulus and strength) measured by 3 point bending, are dependent on their structure; they vary by five orders of magnitude as a function of density and follow power law evolution. However for the same relative density the elastic modulus and strength can increase by one order of magnitude due to a change in connectivity. These structural differences have been observed by SAXS experiments. The effects of the sintering process compared to that of the plastic transformation on the mechanical properties are explained by the associated structural changes. Sintering increases the network connectivity and the densification by compression leads to a new spatial arrangement of the clusters but their internal structure is not affected. In addition, relationships between structural and porous features and the mechanical properties are discussed in terms of percolation theory and the fractal approach. We show that the exponent of the power law does not depend on the fractal feature and percolation is only an approximation which cannot describe results.},

In this paper, we report noninvasive measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. These measurements were made in two ways: by photobleaching of GFP fluorescence and by photoactivation of a red-emitting fluorescent state of GFP (M. B. Elowitz, M. G. Surette, P. E. Wolf, J. Stock, and S. Leibler, Curr. Biol. 7:809-812, 1997). The apparent diffusion coefficient, Da, of GFP in E. coli DH5alpha was found to be 7.7 +/- 2.5 microm2/s. A 72-kDa fusion protein composed of GFP and a cytoplasmically localized maltose binding protein domain moves more slowly, with Da of 2.5 +/- 0.6 microm2/s. In addition, GFP mobility can depend strongly on at least two factors: first, Da is reduced to 3.6 +/- 0.7 microm2/s at high levels of GFP expression; second, the addition to GFP of a small tag consisting of six histidine residues reduces Da to 4.0 +/- 2.0 microm2/s. Thus, a single effective cytoplasmic viscosity cannot explain all values of Da reported here. These measurements have implications for the understanding of intracellular biochemical networks.},

In the absence of enzymes, these same reactions are among the slowest that have ever been measured, some with half-times approaching the age of the Earth. This difference provides a measure of the proficiencies of enzymes as catalysts and their relative susceptibilities to inhibition by transition-state analogue inhibitors. Thermodynamic comparisons between spontaneous and enzyme-catalyzed reactions, coupled with structural information, suggest that in addition to electrostatic and H-bonding interactions, the liberation of water molecules from an enzyme's active site into bulk solvent sometimes plays a prominent role in determining the relative binding affinities of the altered substrate in the ground state and transition state. These comparisons also indicate a high level of synergism in the action of binding determinants of both the substrate and the enzyme, that are not directly involved in the chemical transformation of the substrate but contribute to the rate of its transformation at an enzyme's active site.},

  abstract = {The rates of enzyme reactions fall within a relatively narrow range. To estimate the rate enhancements produced by enzymes, and their expected affinities for transition state analog inhibitors, it is necessary to measure the rates of the corresponding reactions in water in the absence of a catalyst. This review describes the spontaneous cleavages of C-C, C-H, C-N, C-O, P-O, and S-O bonds in biological molecules, as well as the uncatalyzed reactions that correspond to phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by kinases and to peptidyl transfer in the ribosome. The rates of these reactions, some with half-lives in excess of one million years, span an overall range of 10¹⁹-fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be most sensitive to temperature, with rates that increase as much as 10⁷-fold when the temperature is raised from 25° to 100°C. That tendency collapses, by many orders of magnitude, the time that would have been required for chemical evolution on a warm earth. If the catalytic effect of primitive enzymes, like that of modern enzymes and many nonenzymatic catalysts, were mainly to reduce a reaction's enthalpy of activation, then the resulting rate enhancement would have increased automatically as the surroundings cooled. By reducing the time required for early chemical evolution in a warm environment, these findings counter the view that not enough time has passed for terrestrial life to have evolved to its present level of complexity.},

When concentrated whey solution containing 210 g l A1 lactose was used as the nutrient feed, cellular dry weight and PHB concentrations of 87 g l A1 and 69 g l A1 respectively could be obtained in 49 h by pH-stat fed-batch culture. The PHB content was as high as 80\% of the cellular dry weight.

This approach leads to equations for which the domain of validity is not clearly defined, and it provides no theoretical foundation for the prediction of the effective coefficients that appear in the postulated equations. In this paper we treat the intracellular phase and the extracellular phase as continua and use the method of volume averaging to develop the spatially smoothed transport equations for diffusion and reaction in biofilms. This allows us to identify three regimens in which the spatially smoothed transport equations take on special forms. The first of these is the one-equation model that is valid when the principle of local mass equilibrium is satisfied; the second is the two-equation model that is not constrained by the principle of local mass equilibrium; and the third is a pseudo one-equation model. The latter occurs when the reaction in the intracellular phase can be treated as instantaneous. Constraints that identify the domain of validity of these three models are given.},

This paper presents the principles, processes and potential biomedical applications for electrospraying and electrospinning of biomaterials.

On the other hand, some of the unconventional methods for fabricating of the building blocks which can not be assembled by conventional methods are also summarized. These unconventional methods usually involve the formation of supramolecular structures via one type of self-assembly. These structures can subsequently be used as building blocks in another type of self-assembly. To take advantage of these conventional and unconventional methods, a great number of building blocks can be fabricated into multilayer thin films with a defined sequence structure in a designed way.

According to our observations, the effective thermal conductance of the GNR/PEG/water system is higher than that of the GNR/CTAB/water system with a surfactant layer of the same length. We attribute the enhancement of thermal transport to the larger thermal conductance at the GNR/PEG interface as compared with that at the GNR/CTAB interface, in addition to the water penetration into the hydrophilic PEG layer. Our results highlight the role of the GNR/polymer thermal interfaces in designing biological and composite-based heat transfer applications of GNRs, and the importance of multiscale analysis in interpreting transient absorption data in systems consisting of low interfacial thermal conductances.},

These studies shed new light on the role of population structure for the evolution of cooperative interactions and revealed novel molecular mechanisms that stabilize cooperation among cells. New understanding of populations is changing our view of microbial processes, such as pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance, and suggests new ways to fight infection by exploiting social interaction. The study of social interaction is also challenging established paradigms in cancer evolution and immune system dynamics. Finding similar patterns in such diverse systems suggests that the same 'social interaction motifs' may be general to many cell populations.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic links between diet and particular oncogenic mutations in human cancers remain unclear. We recently reported that the ketone body acetoacetate selectively enhances BRAF V600E mutant-dependent MEK1 activation in human cancers. Here we show that a high-fat ketogenic diet increased serum levels of acetoacetate, leading to enhanced tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing human melanoma cells in xenograft mice. Treatment with hypolipidemic agents to lower circulating acetoacetate levels or an inhibitory homolog of acetoacetate, dehydroacetic acid, to antagonize acetoacetate-BRAF V600E binding attenuated BRAF V600E tumor growth. These findings reveal a signaling basis underlying a pathogenic role of dietary fat in BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma, providing insights into the design of conceptualized “precision diets” that may prevent or delay tumor progression based on an individual's specific oncogenic mutation profile.},

Here, we report the crystal structures of Raf1 from cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and its complex with RuBisCO large subunit RbcL. Structural analyses and biochemical assays reveal that each Raf1 dimer captures an RbcL dimer, with the C-terminal tail inserting into the catalytic pocket, and further mediates the assembly of RbcL dimers to form the octameric core of RuBisCO. Furthermore, the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the RbcL–Raf1–RbcS assembly intermediates enable us to see a dynamic assembly process from RbcL8Raf18 to the holoenzyme RbcL8RbcS8. In vitro assays also indicate that Raf1 can attenuate and reverse CcmM-mediated cyanobacterial RuBisCO condensation. Combined with previous findings, we propose a putative model for the assembly of cyanobacterial RuBisCO coordinated by the chaperone Raf1.},

The overhang annealing is supposed to form circular plasmids with staggered breaks, which can be repaired in Escherichia coli after transformation. Here, we demonstrated that the PCR enzyme fills the 5'-overhangs in the early cycles, and the product is then used as the template for exponential amplification. The linear DNA molecules with homologous ends are joined to generate the plasmid with the desired mutations through homologous recombination in E. coli. The correct understanding is important to method improvements, guiding us to use partially overlapping primers and Phusion DNA polymerase for site-directed mutagenesis. Phusion did not amplify a plasmid with complementary primers but used partially overlapping primers to amplify the plasmid, producing linear DNA molecules with homologous ends for site-directed mutagenesis.},

  abstract = {All cells fold their genomes, including bacterial cells, where the chromosome is compacted into a domain-organized meshwork called the nucleoid. How compaction and domain organization arise is not fully understood. Here, we describe a method to estimate the average mesh size of the nucleoid in Escherichia coli. Using nucleoid mesh size and DNA concentration estimates, we find that the cytoplasm behaves as a poor solvent for the chromosome when the cell is considered as a simple semidilute polymer solution. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a poor solvent leads to chromosome compaction and DNA density heterogeneity (i.e., domain formation) at physiological DNA concentration. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the heterogeneous DNA density negatively correlates with ribosome density within the nucleoid, consistent with cryoelectron tomography data. Drug experiments, together with past observations, suggest the hypothesis that RNAs contribute to the poor solvent effects, connecting chromosome compaction and domain formation to transcription and intracellular organization.},

  abstract = {Living organisms evolve complex genetic networks to interact with the environment. Due to the rapid development of synthetic biology, various modularized genetic parts and units have been identified from these networks. They have been employed to construct synthetic genetic circuits, including toggle switches, oscillators, feedback loops and Boolean logic gates. Building on these circuits, complex genetic machines with capabilities in programmable decision-making could be created. Consequently, these accomplishments have led to novel applications, such as dynamic and autonomous modulation of metabolic networks, directed evolution of biological units, remote and targeted diagnostics and therapies, as well as biological containment methods to prevent release of engineered microorganisms and genetic materials. Herein, we outline the principles in genetic circuit design that have initiated a new chapter in transforming concepts to realistic applications. The features of modularized building blocks and circuit architecture that facilitate realization of circuits for a variety of novel applications are discussed. Furthermore, recent advances and challenges in employing genetic circuits to impart microorganisms with distinct and programmable functionalities are highlighted. We envision that this review gives new insights into the design of synthetic genetic circuits and offers a guideline for the implementation of different circuits in various aspects of biotechnology and bioengineering.},

  abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA), also called electrospray technique, has been studied for more than one century. However, since 1990s it has begun to be used to produce and process micro-/nanostructured materials. Owing to the simplicity and flexibility in EHDA experimental setup, it has been successfully employed to generate particulate materials with controllable compositions, structures, sizes, morphologies, and shapes. EHDA has also been used to deposit micro- and nanoparticulate materials on surfaces in a well-controlled manner. All these attributes make EHDA a fascinating tool for preparing and assembling a wide range of micro- and nanostructured materials which have been exploited for use in pharmaceutics, food, and healthcare to name a few. Our goal is to review this field, which allows scientists and engineers to learn about the EHDA technique and how it might be used to create, process, and assemble micro-/nanoparticulate materials with unique and intriguing properties. We begin with a brief introduction to the mechanism and setup of EHDA technique. We then discuss issues critical to successful application of EHDA technique, including control of composition, size, shape, morphology, structure of particulate materials and their assembly. We also illustrate a few of the many potential applications of particulate materials, especially in the area of drug delivery and regenerative medicine. Next, we review the simulation and modeling of Taylor cone-jet formation for a single and co-axial nozzle. The mathematical modeling of particle transport and deposition is presented to provide a deeper understanding of the effective parameters in the preparation, collection and pattering processes. We conclude this article with a discussion on perspectives and future possibilities in this field.},

The intensity of the color formation was correlated to concentrations of the BTEX compounds. Under the optimized conditions, a detection limit (defined as three times the standard deviation of the response obtained from the blank) of 10, 10, 20, and 50 microM was observed for benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene, respectively. The bioassay was selective toward BTEX-related compounds with no interference observed with commonly used pesticides, herbicides, and organic solvent. The bioassay was very stable with little change in response over a 10-week period. The excellent stability suggests that the reported bioassay may be suitable for field monitoring of BTEX to identify and track contaminated water and follow the bioremediation progress.},

A small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study on those hybrid gels has been performed utilizing synchrotron radiation. Intensive positive deviation from Porod's law indicated that there existed density fluctuation within the matrix of silica-PVA hybrid gel. Using the differential d[q3I(q)]/d(q 2) as a variant slo, plotting ln(slo) versus ln(q) can produce the dimension n and the amplitude Fl of density fluctuation. Density fluctuation resulted from both the micropores in gel and Si-O-PVA-O-Si bridge between SiO2 particle and PVA chain. When PVA increased in gel, the decreased micropores reduced the fluctuation but PVA enhanced the fluctuation. With the conjunction of correlation function C(r), it was clear that the bridge of Si-O-PVA-O-Si enlarged the compositional heterogeneity within gel matrix and made n increase with the increase of PVA. In addition, the fluctuation dimension n is a fraction rather than an integer that was formerly predicted by Ruland, which may relate to the fractal structure of hybrid gel. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Eukaryotic sugar transporters of the MFS and SWEET superfamilies consist of 12 and 7 α-helical transmembrane domains (TMs), respectively. Structural analyses indicate that MFS transporters evolved from a series of tandem duplications of an ancestral 3-TM unit. SWEETs are heptahelical proteins carrying a tandem repeat of 3-TM separated by a single TM. Here, we show that prokaryotes have ancestral SWEET homologs with only 3-TM and that the Bradyrhizobium japonicum SemiSWEET1, like Arabidopsis SWEET11, mediates sucrose transport. Eukaryotic SWEETs most likely evolved by internal duplication of the 3-TM, suggesting that SemiSWEETs form oligomers to create a functional pore. However, it remains elusive whether the 7-TM SWEETs are the functional unit or require oligomerization to form a pore sufficiently large to allow for sucrose passage. Split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid and split GFP assays indicate that Arabidopsis SWEETs homo- and heterooligomerize. We examined mutant SWEET variants for negative dominance to test if oligomerization is necessary for function. Mutation of the conserved Y57 or G58 in SWEET1 led to loss of activity. Coexpression of the defective mutants with functional A. thaliana SWEET1 inhibited glucose transport, indicating that homooligomerization is necessary for function. Collectively, these data imply that the basic unit of SWEETs, similar to MFS sugar transporters, is a 3-TM unit and that a functional transporter contains at least four such domains. We hypothesize that the functional unit of the SWEET family of transporters possesses a structure resembling the 12-TM MFS structure, however, with a parallel orientation of the 3-TM unit.},

Colonies are representative of the morphological characteristics of this structured population growth. Pattern formation by single colonies has been intensively studied, whereas the spatial distribution of colonies is poorly investigated. Results: The present study describes a first trial to address the questions of whether and how the spatial distribution of colonies determines the final colony size using the model microorganism Escherichia coli, colonies of which can be grown under well-controlled laboratory conditions. A computational tool for image processing was developed to evaluate colony density, colony size and size variation, and the Voronoi diagram was applied for spatial analysis of colonies with identical space resources. A positive correlation between the final colony size and the Voronoi area was commonly identified, independent of genomic and nutritional differences, which disturbed the colony size and size variation. Conclusions: This novel finding of a universal correlation between the spatial distribution and colony size not only indicated the fair distribution of spatial resources for monogenetic colonies growing with identical space resources but also indicated that the initial localization of the microbial colonies decided by chance determined the fate of the subsequent population growth. This study provides a valuable example for quantitative analysis of the complex microbial ecosystems by means of experimental ecology.},

The introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive blooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera--Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Thallassolituus, Cycloclasticus, Oleispira and a few others (the OHCB)--which are present at low or undetectable levels before the polluting event. The types of OHCB that bloom depend on the latitude/temperature, salinity, redox and other prevailing physical-chemical factors. These blooms result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by supplementation with limiting nutrients. Genome sequencing and functional genomic analysis of Alcanivorax borkumensis, the paradigm of OHCB, has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic routes underlying its special hydrocarbon diet, and its ecological success. These and other studies have revealed the potential of OHCB for multiple biotechnological applications that include not only oil pollution mitigation, but also biopolymer production and biocatalysis.},

  abstract = {Organic osmolytes are small solutes used by cells of numerous water-stressed organisms and tissues to maintain cell volume. Similar compounds are accumulated by some organisms in anhydrobiotic, thermal and possibly pressure stresses. These solutes are amino acids and derivatives, polyols and sugars, methylamines, methylsulfonium compounds and urea. Except for urea, they are often called ;compatible solutes', a term indicating lack of perturbing effects on cellular macromolecules and implying interchangeability. However, these features may not always exist, for three reasons. First, some of these solutes may have unique protective metabolic roles, such as acting as antioxidants (e.g. polyols, taurine, hypotaurine), providing redox balance (e.g. glycerol) and detoxifying sulfide (hypotaurine in animals at hydrothermal vents and seeps). Second, some of these solutes stabilize macromolecules and counteract perturbants in non-interchangeable ways. Methylamines [e.g. trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] can enhance protein folding and ligand binding and counteract perturbations by urea (e.g. in elasmobranchs and mammalian kidney), inorganic ions, and hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea animals. Trehalose and proline in overwintering insects stabilize membranes at subzero temperatures. Trehalose in insects and yeast, and anionic polyols in microorganisms around hydrothermal vents, can protect proteins from denaturation by high temperatures. Third, stabilizing solutes appear to be used in nature only to counteract perturbants of macromolecules, perhaps because stabilization is detrimental in the absence of perturbation. Some of these solutes have applications in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine, including in vitro rescue of the misfolded protein of cystic fibrosis. However, caution is warranted if high levels cause overstabilization of proteins.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanomaterials are novel manufactured materials, having widespread potential applications. Adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) by carbon nanomaterials may enhance their toxicity and affect the fate, transformation, and transport of HOCs in the environment. In this research, adsorption of naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene onto six carbon nanomaterials, including fullerenes, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes was investigated, which is the first systematic study on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) sorption by various carbon nanomaterials. All adsorption isotherms were nonlinear and were fitted well by the Polanyi-Manes model (PMM). Through both isotherm modeling and constructing "characteristic curve", Polanyi theory was useful to describe the adsorption process of PAHs by the carbon nanomaterials. The three fitted parameters (Q(0), a, and b) of PMM depended on both PAH properties and the nature of carbon nanomaterials. For different PAHs, adsorption seems to relate with their molecular size, i.e., the larger the molecular size, the lower the adsorbed volume capacity (Q(0)), but higher a and b values. For different carbon nanomaterials, adsorption seems to relate with their surface area, micropore volume, and the volume ratios of mesopore to micropore. Quantitative relationships between these sorbent properties and the estimated parameters of PMM were obtained. These relationships may represent a first fundamental step toward establishing empirical equations for quantitative prediction of PAH adsorption by carbon nanomaterials and possibly other forms of carbonaceous (geo-) sorbents, and for evaluating their environmental impact. In addition, high adsorption capacity of PAHs by carbon nanotubes may add to their high environmental risks once released to the environment, and result in potential alteration of PAHs fate and bioavailability in the environment.},

Single-solute sorption results were reported in the literature, however, they cannot be used for predicting pollutant sorption by CNTs in wastewater and natural water systems where multiple organic contaminants are present. In this study, competitive sorption of pyrene, phenanthrene, and naphthalene on a multiwalled CNT material was investigated. All isotherms in single-, bi-, and tri-solute systems were fitted well by the Dubinin-Ashtakhov (DA) model. The isotherm of a given primary solute changed from being significantly nonlinear to nearly linear when competitors were added. The observed competitive sorption depended on the relative equilibrium concentrations of both primary and cosolutes. Significant competition was observed at relatively low concentrations of primary solute and high concentrations of competitors, while competition was much weaker in the case of relatively high concentrations of primary solute and low competitor concentrations. When the relative concentration of primary solute (Ce/Cs) approached 1, competition by other solutes seemed to disappear. Sorption and competition of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on CNTs could not be explained with either pore-filling or partition-adsorption mechanisms. A Polanyi-based surface adsorption mechanism was proposed to interpret the observed sorption and competition.},

Pdu MCPs are a family of bacterial microcompartments that are self-assembled from hundreds of proteins within the bacterial cytosol. Here, we seek a comprehensive understanding of the stoichiometric composition and organisation of Pdu MCPs. We obtain accurate stoichiometry of shell proteins and internal enzymes of the natural Pdu MCP by QconCAT-driven quantitative mass spectrometry. Genetic deletion of the major shell protein and absolute quantification reveal the stoichiometric and structural remodelling of metabolically functional Pdu MCPs. Decoding the precise protein stoichiometry allows us to develop an organisational model of the Pdu metabolosome. The structural insights into the Pdu MCP are critical for both delineating the general principles underlying bacterial organelle formation, structural robustness and function, and repurposing natural microcompartments using synthetic biology for biotechnological applications.},

Transforming the library into an L-lactate-secreting Synechocystis strain and sorting top lactate producers enriches clones with sgRNAs targeting nutrient assimilation, central carbon metabolism, and cyclic electron flow.

This study describes the development of methods for using a cyanuric acid-degrading enzyme contained within nonliving cells that were encapsulated within a porous silica matrix. Initially, three different bacterial cyanuric acid hydrolases were compared: TrzD from \{{$<\rbrace$}named-content content-type="genus-species"\{{$>\rbrace$}Acidovorax citrulli\{{$<\rbrace$}/named-content\{{$>\rbrace$} strain 12227, AtzD from \{{$<\rbrace$}named-content content-type="genus-species"\{{$>\rbrace$}Pseudomonas\{{$<\rbrace$}/named-content\{{$>\rbrace$} sp. strain ADP, and CAH from \{{$<\rbrace$}named-content content-type="genus-species"\{{$>\rbrace$}Moorella thermoacetica\{{$<\rbrace$}/named-content\{{$>\rbrace$} ATCC 39073. Each enzyme was expressed recombinantly in \{{$<\rbrace$}named-content content-type="genus-species"\{{$>\rbrace$}Escherichia coli\{{$<\rbrace$}/named-content\{{$>\rbrace$} and tested for cyanuric acid hydrolase activity using freely suspended or encapsulated cell formats. Cyanuric acid hydrolase activities differed by only a 2-fold range when comparing across the different enzymes with a given format. A practical water filtration system is most likely to be used with nonviable cells, and all cells were rendered nonviable by heat treatment at 70°C for 1 h. Only the CAH enzyme from the thermophile \{{$<\rbrace$}named-content content-type="genus-species"\{{$>\rbrace$}M. thermoacetica\{{$<\rbrace$}/named-content\{{$>\rbrace$} retained significant activity under those conditions, and so it was tested in a flowthrough system simulating a bioreactive pool filter. Starting with a cyanuric acid concentration of 10,000 \$μ\$M, more than 70\{\%\} of the cyanuric acid was degraded in 24 h, it was completely removed in 72 h, and a respike of 10,000 \$μ\$M cyanuric acid a week later showed identical biodegradation kinetics. An experiment conducted with water obtained from municipal swimming pools showed the efficacy of the process, although cyanuric acid degradation rates decreased by 50\{\%\} in the presence of 4.5 ppm hypochlorite. In total, these experiments demonstrated significant robustness of cyanuric acid hydrolase and the silica bead materials in remediation. \{{$<\rbrace$}/p\{{$>\rbrace\vphantom{\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}}$}},

Unraveling this complexity will require the use of live-cell fluorescence microscopy, but is impeded by the inherent fluorescent background associated with light-harvesting pigments and the need to feed photosynthetic cells light. Here, we outline a roadmap for overcoming these challenges. Specifically, we show that although basic cyanobacterial biology creates challenging experimental constraints, these restrictions can be mitigated by the careful choice of fluorophores and microscope instrumentation. Many of these choices are motivated by recent successful live-cell studies. We therefore also highlight how live-cell imaging has advanced our understanding of bacterial microcompartments, circadian rhythm, and the organization and segregation of the bacterial nucleoid.},

Perturbing each circuit element revealed parameters that control the degree to which the cell communicated with itself versus with its neighbors. This tunable interplay of self-communication and neighbor communication enables cells to span a diverse repertoire of cellular behaviors. These include a cell being asocial by responding only to itself and social through quorum sensing, and an isogenic population of cells splitting into social and asocial subpopulations. A mathematical model explained these behaviors. The versatility of the secrete-and-sense circuit motif may explain its recurrence across species.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach cell biology research. The dimensions of microfluidic channels are well suited to the physical scale of biological cells, and the many advantages of microfluidics make it an attractive platform for new techniques in biology. One of the key benefits of microfluidics for basic biology is the ability to control parameters of the cell microenvironment at relevant length and time scales. Considerable progress has been made in the design and use of novel microfluidic devices for culturing cells and for subsequent treatment and analysis. With the recent pace of scientific discovery, it is becoming increasingly important to evaluate existing tools and techniques, and to synthesize fundamental concepts that would further improve the efficiency of biological research at the microscale. This tutorial review integrates fundamental principles from cell biology and local microenvironments with cell culture techniques and concepts in microfluidics. Culturing cells in microscale environments requires knowledge of multiple disciplines including physics, biochemistry, and engineering. We discuss basic concepts related to the physical and biochemical microenvironments of the cell, physicochemical properties of that microenvironment, cell culture techniques, and practical knowledge of microfluidic device design and operation. We also discuss the most recent advances in microfluidic cell culture and their implications on the future of the field. The goal is to guide new and interested researchers to the important areas and challenges facing the scientific community as we strive toward full integration of microfluidics with biology. © 2010 Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The protocol involves seeding and growing bacteria on small agarose pads and imaging the resulting microcolonies. Images are then reviewed and analyzed using our laboratory's custom MATLAB analysis code, which segments and tracks cells in a frame-to-frame method. This process yields quantitative expression data on cell lineages, which can illustrate dynamic expression profiles and facilitate mathematical models of gene circuits. With fast-growing bacteria, such as E. coli or B. subtilis, image acquisition can be completed in 1 d, with an additional 1-2 d for progressing through the analysis procedure.},

  abstract = {Why do bacteria have shape? Is morphology valuable or just a trivial secondary characteristic? Why should bacteria have one shape instead of another? Three broad considerations suggest that bacterial shapes are not accidental but are biologically important: cells adopt uniform morphologies from among a wide variety of possibilities, some cells modify their shape as conditions demand, and morphology can be tracked through evolutionary lineages. All of these imply that shape is a selectable feature that aids survival. The aim of this review is to spell out the physical, environmental, and biological forces that favor different bacterial morphologies and which, therefore, contribute to natural selection. Specifically, cell shape is driven by eight general considerations: nutrient access, cell division and segregation, attachment to surfaces, passive dispersal, active motility, polar differentiation, the need to escape predators, and the advantages of cellular differentiation. Bacteria respond to these forces by performing a type of calculus, integrating over a number of environmental and behavioral factors to produce a size and shape that are optimal for the circumstances in which they live. Just as we are beginning to answer how bacteria create their shapes, it seems reasonable and essential that we expand our efforts to understand why they do so.},

We use a suite of visualization techniques to evaluate scaffold assembly and dynamics. We demonstrate recruitment of target cargo molecules onto assembled scaffolds by appending reciprocally interacting adaptor domains. These interactions can be refined by fine-tuning the scaffold expression level. Real-time observation of this system reveals a nucleation-limited step where multiple scaffolds initially form within a cell. Over time, nucleated scaffolds reorganize into a single intracellular assembly, likely due to interscaffold competition for protein subunits. Our results suggest design considerations for using self-assembling proteins as building blocks to construct nanoscaffolds, while also providing a platform to visualize scaffold-cargo dynamics in vivo.},

  abstract = {A novel amperometric phenol sensor was constructed by immobilizing tyrosinase in a titania sol-gel matrix. The tyrosinase entrapped sol-gel film was obtained with a vapor deposition method, which simplified the traditional sol-gel process and avoided the shrinkage and cracking of conventional sol-gel-derived glasses. This matrix provided a microenvironment for retaining the native structure and activity of the entrapped enzyme and a very low mass transport barrier to the enzyme substrates. Phenol could be oxidized by dissolving oxygen in presence of immobilized tyrosinase to form a detectable product, which was determined at -150 mV without any mediator. The phenol sensor exhibited a fast response (less than 5 s) and sensitivity as high as 103 μA/mM, which resulted from the porous structure and high enzyme loading of the sol-gel matrix. The linear range for phenol determination was from 1.2×10-7to 2.6×10-4M with a detection limit of 1.0×10-7M. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of the encapsulated tyrosinase was calculated to be (0.29±0.02) mM. The stability of the biosensor was also evaluated. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that modulating these sequences can tune the steady-state abundance of proteins over 2 orders of magnitude in cells. This is the same dynamic range as seen for inducing ubiquitination through a classic N-end rule degron. The stability and abundance of His3 constructs dictated by the initiation site affect survival of yeast cells and show that variation in proteasomal initiation can affect fitness. The proteasome's sequence preferences are linked directly to the affinity of the initiation sites to their receptor on the proteasome and are conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and human cells. These findings establish that the sequence composition of unstructured initiation sites influences protein abundance in vivo in an evolutionarily conserved manner and can affect phenotype and fitness.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in nanotechnology offer nano sized or nanostructured pharmaceutical particles, being as small as the size of cells such as receptors or nucleic acids, which can be engineered to pro- vide enhanced ef ficacy, solubility, or biocompatibility, and to administer at much lower dosages. However, industrial production of these particles is still challenging. Among different techniques, aerosol based ones might be favorable since they are considered as contamination free processes and do not interfere with complex molecules of drugs. We, in this review, consider liquid atomiza- tion, where droplet formation is followed by conversion into solid particles. The best candidate is a method, which not only produces mono sized droplets with a diameter smaller than the inside nozzle diameter but also generates small enough start up sizes. Such a method is found in: Electro-Hydrody- namic Atomization (EHDA) or Electrospraying. Electrospraying is now a well practiced technique for producing very fine monodisperse droplets from a liquid under the influence of electrical forces. By controlling the liquid flow rate and the electrostatic potential between the liquid and the counter electrode, droplets within a narrow size range can be generated, while the mean diameter ranges from nanometers up to several micrometers. Besides generating monodisperse droplets, electrosprays are also distinguished by their self dispersing nature due to Coulomb repulsion, the possibility of tra- jectory control of the produced charged droplets, and the reduced risk of nozzle clogging due to the large size of the orifice compared to the size of the droplets. We will discuss different spraying modes depending on the strength of the electric stresses relative to the surface tension stress on the liquid surface and on the inertia of the liquid leaving the nozzle. However, for the production of monodis- perse nanoparticles the so called cone-jet mode will be explained in depth. Scaling laws can be used to estimate the operational conditions for producing nanodroplets of a certain size. Hartman and co- workers refined the scaling laws for EHDA in the Cone-Jet mode using theoretically derived models for the cone, jet, and droplet size. By means of several examples, a generic way to produce nanopar- ticles, via scaling laws, from a multitude of different precursors will be discussed. Several examples of medicine particles with different properties made by EHDA will be given. Processes based on bipolar coagulation, where oppositely charged carrier particles and nano sized active agents are brought together to form composite drugs, will be discussed. Finally some attention will be given to challenges on},

Generally, biomimetic synthesis can be conducted either by mimicking the functions of natural materials/structures or by mimicking the biological processes that organisms employ to produce substances or materials. Biomimetic synthesis is therefore divided here into "functional biomimetic synthesis" and "process biomimetic synthesis". Process biomimetic synthesis is the focus of this review. First, the above two terms are defined and their relationship is discussed. Next different levels of biological processes that can be used for process biomimetic synthesis are compiled. Then the current progress of process biomimetic synthesis is systematically summarized and reviewed from the following five perspectives: i) elementary biomimetic system via biomass templates, ii) high-level biomimetic system via soft/hard-combined films, iii) intelligent biomimetic systems via liquid membranes, iv) living-organism biomimetic systems, and v) macromolecular bioinspired systems. Moreover, for these five biomimetic systems, the synthesis procedures, basic principles, and relationships are discussed, and the challenges that are encountered and directions for further development are considered.},

  abstract = {Molecular self-assembly is a powerful approach for fabricating novel supramolecular architectures. It is ubiquitous in the natural world (see Box 1): lipid molecules form oil drops in water; four hemoglobin polypeptides form a functional tetrameric hemoglo-bin protein; ribosomal proteins and RNA coalesce into functional ribosomes. Molecular self-assembly is mediated by weak, noncovalent bonds—notably hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds (electrostatic interac-tions), hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. Although these bonds are rela-tively insignificant in isolation, when combined together as a whole, they govern the structural conformation of all biological macromol-ecules and influence their interaction with other molecules. The water-mediated hydrogen bond is especially important for living systems, as all biological materials interact with water. All biomolecules, including peptides and proteins, interact and self-organize to form well-defined structures that are associated with functionality 1 . By observing the processes by which supramol-ecular architectures are assembled in nature 1–3 , we can begin to exploit self-assembly for the synthesis of entirely novel synthetic materials. Peptides and proteins are versatile building blocks for fabricating materials. Nature has already used them as scaffolds to produce a dizzying array of materials, including collagen, keratin, pearl, shell, coral and calcite microlenses, and optical waveguides. In this review, I focus on the fabrication of diverse molecular struc-tures through self-assembly of peptides, proteins, and lipids. As the use of genetically engineered polypeptides for specifically binding selected inorganic compounds to assemble functional nanostructures has recently been reviewed 4 , it will not be discussed in detail here. For other aspects of nanomaterials synthesis, namely chemistry-driven approaches to materials synthesis (e.g., self assembly of organic ligands and metal ions into three-dimensional hollow cages or metalloden-drimers) and in vitro systems for artificial protein synthesis, the reader is referred elsewhere 5–8 . Fabrication of nanofibers Work in my laboratory has focused on fabricating several self-assembling peptides and proteins for a variety of studies and biomate-rials (Fig. 1). Examples include ionic self-complementary peptides 9–11 , which form β-sheet structures in aqueous solution with two distinct surfaces—one hydrophilic, the other hydrophobic (rather like the pegs and holes in Lego bricks). The hydrophobic residues shield themselves from water and self-assemble in water in a manner similar to that seen in the case of protein folding in vivo. The unique structural feature of these 'molecular Lego' peptides is that they form complementary ionic bonds with regular repeats on the hydrophilic surface (Fig. 1a). The complementary ionic sides have been classified into several moduli (modulus I, modulus II, modulus III, modulus IV, etc., and mixtures thereof). This classification scheme is based on the hydrophilic sur-faces of the molecules, which have alternating positively and negatively charged amino acids alternating by one residue, two residues, three residues and so on. For example, charge arrangements for modulus I, modulus II, modulus III and modulus IV are – + – + – + –+, – – + + – – + +, – – – + + + and – – – – + + + +, respectively. The charge},

  abstract = {Cell-free synthetic (enzymatic) pathway biotransformation (SyPaB) is the assembly of a number of purified enzymes (usually more than 10) and coenzymes for the production of desired products through complicated biochemical reaction networks that a single enzyme cannot do. Cell-free SyPaB, as compared to microbial fermentation, has several distinctive advantages, such as high product yield, great engineering flexibility, high product titer, and fast reaction rate. Biocommodities (e.g., ethanol, hydrogen, and butanol) are low-value products where costs of feedstock carbohydrates often account for approximately 30-70\% of the prices of the products. Therefore, yield of biocommodities is the most important cost factor, and the lowest yields of profitable biofuels are estimated to be ca. 70\% of the theoretical yields of sugar-to-biofuels based on sugar prices of ca. US\$ 0.18 per kg. The opinion that SyPaB is too costly for producing low-value biocommodities are mainly attributed to the lack of stable standardized building blocks (e.g., enzymes or their complexes), costly labile coenzymes, and replenishment of enzymes and coenzymes. In this perspective, I propose design principles for SyPaB, present several SyPaB examples for generating hydrogen, alcohols, and electricity, and analyze the advantages and limitations of SyPaB. The economical analyses clearly suggest that developments in stable enzymes or their complexes as standardized parts, efficient coenzyme recycling, and use of low-cost and more stable biomimetic coenzyme analogs, would result in much lower production costs than do microbial fermentations because the stabilized enzymes have more than 3 orders of magnitude higher weight-based total turn-over numbers than microbial biocatalysts, although extra costs for enzyme purification and stabilization are spent.},

Therefore, the fate and transport of CNTs in aqueous solutions have attracted extensive attention. In the present work, the effects of natural organic matter (NOM), solution pH and ionic strength on adsorption of three synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) by both pristine and surface functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were investigated. The three SOCs (phenanthrene, biphenyl, and 2-phenylphenol) with different planarity, polarity, and hydrogen/electron-donor/acceptor ability, representing typical scenarios for the SOC-CNT interactions, were employed as probe molecules. Among the three background solution characteristics examined, NOM showed the most significant effect on SOC adsorption, while solution pH and ionic strength exhibited minimal or negligible impacts. The presence of NOM greatly suppressed the SOC adsorption by CNTs, and the impact on the SWNTs was higher than that on the MWNTs. The planarity and hydrophobicity of SOCs were two important factors determining the effects of NOM, solution pH and ionic strength on their adsorption by CNTs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Background: Cyanobacterial carbohydrates, such as sucrose, have been considered as potential renewable feedstock to support the production of fuels and chemicals. However, the separation and purification processes of these carbohydrates will increase the production cost of chemicals. Co-culture fermentation has been proposed as an efficient and economical way to utilize these cyanobacterial carbohydrates. However, studies on the application of co-culture systems to achieve green biosynthesis of platform chemicals are still rare. Results: In this study, we successfully achieved one-step conversion of sucrose derived from cyanobacteria to fine chemicals by constructing a microbial consortium consisting of the fast-growing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 and Escherichia coli to sequentially produce sucrose and then the platform chemical 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) from CO2 under photoautotrophic growth conditions. First, efforts were made to overexpress the sucrose permease-coding gene cscB under the strong promoter P cpc560 in S. elongatus UTEX 2973 for efficient sucrose secretion. Second, the sucrose catabolic pathway and malonyl-CoA-dependent 3-HP biosynthetic pathway were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for heterologous biosynthesis of 3-HP from sucrose. By optimizing the cultivation temperature from 37 to 30 °C, a stable artificial consortium system was constructed with the capability of producing 3-HP at up to 68.29 mg/L directly from CO2. In addition, cell growth of S. elongatus UTEX 2973 in the consortium was enhanced, probably due to the quick quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the system by E. coli, which in turn improved the photosynthesis of cyanobacteria. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility of the one-step conversion of sucrose to fine chemicals using an artificial consortium system. The study also confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria could promote the cell growth of cyanobacteria by relieving oxidative stress in this microbial consortium, which further suggests the potential value of this system for future industrial applications.},

Cyanobacterial cells exhibit an extraordinary diversity in their size and shape, and bacterial cell morphology largely depends on the synthesis and the dynamics of the peptidoglycan (PG) layer. Here, we used a fluorescence analog of the PG synthesis precursor D-Ala, 7-Hydroxycoumarin-amino-D-alanine (HADA), to probe the PG synthesis pattern in live cells of cyanobacteria with different morphology. They displayed diverse synthesis patterns, with some strains showing an intensive HADA incorporation at the septal region, whereas others gave an HADA signal distributed around the cells. Growth zones covering several cells at the tips of the filament were present in some filamentous strains such as in Arthrospira. In Anabaena PCC 7120, which is capable of differentiating heterocysts for N2 fixation, PG synthesis followed the cell division cycle. In addition, an HADA incorporation was strongly activated from 12 to 15 h following the initiation of heterocyst development, indicating a thickening of the PG layer in heterocysts. The PG synthesis pattern is diverse in cyanobacteria and responds to developmental regulation. The use of fluorescent analogs may serve as a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of cell growth and morphogenesis operating in these organisms.},

  abstract = {γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is widely used as a pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and as a precursor for synthesizing materials for industrial use. Bacterial cells can be exploited for use as biocatalysts with the potential to synthesize compounds such as GABA with greater efficiency, safety, and economy. However, efforts to use biocatalysts must overcome the permeability barrier of the cell envelope. Therefore, to produce a whole-cell biocatalyst with enhanced cell-associated glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity, we overexpressed the Glutamate (Glu)-GABA antiporter (GadC) in Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3)-pET28a- gadB). The cell-associated GAD activity of the transformants was higher by a factor of 2.6 in comparison; however, expression of GadC inhibited growth. Therefore, we permeabilized the cells using either organic solvents, surfactants, or heat. Permeabilization with organic solvents increased cell-associated GAD activity as a function of their hydrophobicity, and hexane was the most effective, increasing cell-associated GAD activity by a factor of 9.65 (6.72 U/mg). The surfactants Triton X-100, CHAPS, NP-40, OGP, and Brij-35 enhanced cell-associated GAD activity, and Triton X-100 was the most effective, increasing cell-associated GAD activity by a factor of 10.8 (7.53 U/mg). Heating BL21(DE3)-pET28a-gadB at 70 °C for 30 min increased cell-associated GAD activity by a factor of 13.1. GAD did not leak from the permeabilized cells under optimum conditions. When the heat-permeabilized cells were immobilized on Ca-alginate gel beads, the biotransformation ability of beads maintained over 60\% of their initial ability after 20 consecutive batches, and the beads retained 90\% of their initial activity after 30 days of storage. These approaches for improving cell permeability to enhance cell-associated GAD activity show great promise for decreasing the cost of industrial production of GABA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In comparison, all attempts failed when using complete-overlapping primer pairs as recommended in the standard QuickChange protocol. Our protocol was further extended to site-saturation mutagenesis by introducing randomized codons. Our data indicated no specific sequence selection during library construction, with the randomized positions resulting in average occurrence of each base in each position. This method should be useful to facilitate the preparation of high-quality site saturation libraries.},

The chip is mainly composed of an upstream concentration gradient generator and a downstream perfusion-based chemotatic module. The processes of toxic liquid dilution and diffusion, microalgal culturing, cell stimulation, and online screening can be integrated in this chip, which makes it an attractive approach to simplify toxicity testing procedures. The microalgal motility was adopted as a microfluidic bioassay signal and was evaluated as the percentage of motile cells, curvilinear velocity, average path velocity, and straight line velocity. Two mobile marine microalgae, Platymonas subcordiformis and Platymonas helgolandica var. tsingtaoensis, were confined in the chemotatic module and stimulated by the eight concentration gradients of Cu and Cd generated by the concentration gradient generator. In all cases, a toxic response was detected (i.e., a dose-related inhibition of motility was observed). Only 1.5 h was needed to predict EC50 values. Thus, the microfluidic chip developed was proved to be useful as a simple and rapid approach in heavy metal detection and might be expanded as a conventional test method in environmental toxicity assessment. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

However, PDMS's hydrophobicity and fast hydrophobic recovery after surface hydrophilization, attributed to its low glass transition temperature of less than -120 degrees C, negatively impacts on the performance of PDMS-based microfluidic device components. This issue has spawned a flurry of research to devise longer lasting surface modifications of PDMS, with particular emphasis on microfluidic applications. This review will present recent research on surface modifications of PDMS using techniques ranging from metal layer coatings and layer-by-layer depositions to dynamic surfactant treatments and the adsorption of amphipathic proteins. We will also discuss significant advances that have been made with a broad palette of gas-phase processing methods including plasma processing, sol-gel coatings and chemical vapor deposition. Finally, we will present examples of applications and future prospects of modified PDMS surfaces in microfluidics, in areas such as molecular separations, cell culture in microchannels and biomolecular detection via immunoassays.},

Problems arise when parts of pathways require specialized environments or compartments for optimal function. Here we solve this problem through co-culture of engineered organisms, each of which contains the part of the pathway that it is best suited to hosting. In one example, we divided the synthetic pathway for the acetylated diol paclitaxel precursor into two modules, expressed in either S. cerevisiae or E. coli, neither of which can produce the paclitaxel precursor on their own. Stable co-culture in the same bioreactor was achieved by designing a mutualistic relationship between the two species in which a metabolic intermediate produced by E. coli was used and functionalized by yeast. This synthetic consortium produced 33 mg/L oxygenated taxanes, including a monoacetylated dioxygenated taxane. The same method was also used to produce tanshinone precursors and functionalized sesquiterpenes.},

Previous theoretical arithmetic analysis suggests that the light reactions and dark reactions are imperfectly coupled due to shortage of ATP supply, or accumulation of NADPH. Here we hypothesized that solely increasing NADPH consumption might improve the coupling of light reactions and dark reactions, thereby increasing the photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. To test this hypothesis, an NADPH consumption pathway was constructed in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The resulting extra NADPH-consuming mutant grew much faster and achieved a higher biomass concentration. Analyses of photosynthesis characteristics showed the activities of photosystem II and photosystem I and the light saturation point of the NADPH-consuming mutant all significantly increased. Thus, we demonstrated that introducing extra NADPH consumption ability is a promising strategy to increase photosynthetic efficiency and to enable utilization of high-intensity lights.},

  abstract = {Alginate encapsulation matrices selectively retained hydrogen producing biomass, achieving reliable high-rate production of hydrogen at various operating conditions. In addition to methane gas, higher-value resources such as hydrogen gas are produced during anaerobic wastewater treatment. They are, however, immediately consumed by other organisms. To recover these high-value resources, not only do the desired phenotypes need to be retained in the anaerobic reactor, but the undesired ones need to be washed out. In this study, a well-established alginate-based polymer gel, with and without a coating layer, was used to selectively encapsulate hydrogen-producing biomass in beads to achieve high-rate recovery of hydrogen during anaerobic wastewater treatment. The effect of cross-linking agents, Ca 2+ , Sr 2+ , and Ba 2+ , as well as a composite coating on the beads, consisting of alternating layers of polyethylenimine and silica hydrogel, were investigated with respect to their performance, specifically, their mass transfer characteristics and their differential ability to retain the encapsulated biomass. Although the coating reduced the escape rate of encapsulated biomass from the beads, all alginate polymer matrices without coating effectively retained biomass. Fast diffusion of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) through the polymer gel was observed in both Ca-alginate and Sr-alginate without coating. The coating, however, decreased either the diffusivity or the permeability of the DOC depending on whether the DOC was from synthetic wastewater (more lipids and proteins) or real brewery wastewater (more sugars). Consequently, the encapsulation system with coating became diffusion limited when brewery wastewater with high chemical oxygen demand was fed, resulting in a lower hydrogen production rate than the uncoated encapsulation systems. In all cases the encapsulated biomass was able to produce hydrogen, even at a hydraulic residence time of 45 min. Although there are limitations to this system, the used of encapsulated biomass for resource recovery from wastewater shows promise, particularly for high-rate systems in which the retention of specific phenotypes is desired.},

The recent developments on the preparation, characterization, properties, and applications of this type of nanocomposite have been reviewed. Principally, three methods for the preparation of polymer/silica nanocomposites can be used, blending, the sol-gel process, and in situ polymerization. All the three methods have been investigated extensively. Moreover, colloidal polymer/silica nanocomposites, which represent a new category of polymer/silica nanocomposites, have attracted growing interest in recent years. Apart from the properties of individual components in a nanocomposite, the degree of dipersion of nanoparticles in the polymer and the interfacial interaction play important roles in enhancing of limiting the overall properties of the system. Some trends are observed but no universal patterns for the behavior of polymer nanocomposites can be deduced in general. The properties of polymer/silica nanocomposites, however, are generally superior to the pure polymer matrix and polymer microcomposites. In particular, they commonly exhibit improved mechanical properties and thermal stability regardless of the preparative method. "It's all interface" refers to the large volume fraction of interfacial polymer compared with the volume fraction of filler. By taking advantage of this large interfacial area and interfacial volume, unique combinations of properties of polymer nanocomposite can be achieved. Although much work has already been done on various aspects of polymer/silica nanocomposites, more research is required in order to further understand the complex structure-property relationships. Tailoring the interfacial interaction of filler/matrix is conducive to a better understanding of the relationships. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},
