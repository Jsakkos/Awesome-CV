  abstract = {Carboxysomes are a class of bacterial microcompartments that form proteinaceous organelles within the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria and play a central role in photosynthetic metabolism by defining a cellular microenvironment permissive to CO2 fixation. Critical aspects of the assembly of the carboxysomes remain relatively unknown, especially with regard to the dynamics of this microcompartment. We have recently expressed an exogenous protease as a way of gaining control over endogenous protein levels, including carboxysomal components, in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcous elongatus PCC 7942. By utilizing this system, proteins that compose the carboxysome can be tuned in real-time as a method to examine carboxysome dynamics. Yet, analysis of subtle changes in carboxysome morphology with microscopy remains a low-throughput and subjective process. Here we use deep learning techniques, specifically a Rotationally Invariant Variational Autoencoder (rVAE), to analyze the fluorescence microscopy images and quantitatively evaluate how carboxysome shell remodelling impacts trends in the morphology of the microcompartment over time. We find that rVAEs are able to assist in the quantitative evaluation of changes in carboxysome location, shape, and size over time. We propose that rVAEs may be a useful tool to accelerate the analysis of carboxysome assembly and dynamics in response to genetic or environmental perturbation, and may be more generally useful to probe regulatory processes involving a broader array of bacterial microcompartments.},

Silica gels have been investigated for bioencapsulation, yet few studies have focused on gel mechanical properties and biocatalytic activity simultaneously, instead studying the viability of the encapsulated microorganisms. In order to utilize these unique biocatalytic functionalities in the context of industrially relevant processes, bioencapsulation materials with high mechanical strength are required. Herein, we report the development of silica gels for bioremediation based on varying ratios of silicon alkoxide and silica nanoparticles. The results of this study indicate that the alkoxide to nanoparticle ratio can be used to control the gel mechanical properties as well as the biocatalytic activity.},

NCIB 9816-4, a bacterium that degrades a broad spectrum of aromatic pollutants. The adsorbent matrix was synthesized using silica precursors methyltrimethoxysilane and tetramethoxysilane to maximize the adsorption capacity of the matrix while maintaining a highly networked and porous microstructure. The encapsulated bacteria enhanced the removal rate and capacity of the matrix for an aromatic chemical mixture. Repeated use of the material over four cycles was conducted to demonstrate that the removal capacity could be maintained with combined adsorption and biodegradation. The silica biogel can thus be used extensively without the need for disposal, as a result of continuous biodegradation by the encapsulated bacteria. However, an inverse trend was observed with the ratio of biodegradation to adsorption as a function of log K ow , suggesting increasing mass-transport limitation for the most hydrophobic chemicals used (log K ow {$>$} 4).},

An ABM that accounts for CO2, light, sucrose export rate and cell-to-cell mechanical interactions was used to investigate the growth of an engineered sucrose-exporting strain of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The ABM simulations produced population curves and synthetic images of colony growth. The curves and the images were analyzed, and growth was correlated to nutrients availability and colonies’ initial spatial distribution. To speed up the ABM simulations, a metamodel based on a Recurrent Neural Network, RNN, was trained on the synthetic images of growth. This metamodel successfully reproduced the population curves and the images of growth at a lower computational cost. The computational framework presented here paves the road towards designing microbial communities containing sucrose-exporting Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 by exploring the solution space in silico first.},

  abstract = {The disruption of bacterial signaling (quorum quenching) has been proven to be an innovative approach to influence the behavior of bacteria. In particular, lactonase enzymes that are capable of hydrolyzing the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules used by numerous bacteria, were reported to inhibit biofilm formation, including those of freshwater microbial communities. However, insights and tools are currently lacking to characterize, understand and explain the effects of signal disruption on complex microbial communities. Here we produced silica capsules containing an engineered lactonase that exhibits quorum quenching activity. Capsules were used to design a filtration cartridge to selectively degrade AHLs from a recirculating bioreactor. The growth of a complex microbial community in the bioreactor, in the presence or absence of lactonase, was monitored over a 3 weeks period. Dynamic population analysis revealed that signal disruption using a quorum quenching lactonase can effectively reduce biofilm formation in the recirculating bioreactor system and that biofilm inhibition is concomitant to drastic changes in the composition, diversity and abundance of soil bacterial communities within these biofilms. Effects of the quorum quenching lactonase on suspension community also affected the microbial population composition, suggesting that effects of signal disruption are not limited to biofilm populations. This unexpected finding is evidence for the importance of signaling in the competition between bacteria within communities. This study provides foundational tools and data for the investigation of the importance of AHL-based signaling in the context of complex microbial communities.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms possess a variety of mechanisms to achieve balance between absorbed light (source) and the capacity to metabolically utilize or dissipate this energy (sink). While regulatory processes that detect changes in metabolic status/balance are relatively well-studied in plants, analogous pathways remain poorly characterized in photosynthetic microbes. Herein, we explore systemic changes that result from alterations in carbon availability in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 by taking advantage of an engineered strain where influx/efflux of a central carbon metabolite, sucrose, can be regulated experimentally. We observe that induction of a high-flux sucrose export pathway leads to depletion of internal carbon storage pools (glycogen), and concurrent increases in photosynthetic parameters. Further, a proteome-wide analysis and fluorescence reporter-based analysis revealed that upregulated factors following the activation of the metabolic sink are strongly concentrated on ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) and axillary modules involved in Rubisco maturation. Carboxysome number and Rubisco activity also increase following engagement of sucrose secretion. Conversely, reversing the flux of sucrose by feeding exogenous sucrose heterologously results in increased glycogen pools, decreased Rubisco abundance, decreased photosystem II quantum efficiency, and carboxysome reorganization. Our data suggest that Rubisco activity and organization are key outputs connected to regulatory pathways involved in metabolic balancing in cyanobacteria. One sentence summary Rubisco activity and organization are key outputs involve in source-sink balancing in cyanobacteria.},

We use a suite of visualization techniques to evaluate scaffold assembly and dynamics. We demonstrate recruitment of target cargo molecules onto assembled scaffolds by appending reciprocally interacting adaptor domains. These interactions can be refined by fine-tuning the scaffold expression level. Real-time observation of this system reveals a nucleation-limited step where multiple scaffolds initially form within a cell. Over time, nucleated scaffolds reorganize into a single intracellular assembly, likely due to interscaffold competition for protein subunits. Our results suggest design considerations for using self-assembling proteins as building blocks to construct nanoscaffolds, while also providing a platform to visualize scaffold-cargo dynamics in vivo.},

  abstract = {Alginate encapsulation matrices selectively retained hydrogen producing biomass, achieving reliable high-rate production of hydrogen at various operating conditions. In addition to methane gas, higher-value resources such as hydrogen gas are produced during anaerobic wastewater treatment. They are, however, immediately consumed by other organisms. To recover these high-value resources, not only do the desired phenotypes need to be retained in the anaerobic reactor, but the undesired ones need to be washed out. In this study, a well-established alginate-based polymer gel, with and without a coating layer, was used to selectively encapsulate hydrogen-producing biomass in beads to achieve high-rate recovery of hydrogen during anaerobic wastewater treatment. The effect of cross-linking agents, Ca 2+ , Sr 2+ , and Ba 2+ , as well as a composite coating on the beads, consisting of alternating layers of polyethylenimine and silica hydrogel, were investigated with respect to their performance, specifically, their mass transfer characteristics and their differential ability to retain the encapsulated biomass. Although the coating reduced the escape rate of encapsulated biomass from the beads, all alginate polymer matrices without coating effectively retained biomass. Fast diffusion of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) through the polymer gel was observed in both Ca-alginate and Sr-alginate without coating. The coating, however, decreased either the diffusivity or the permeability of the DOC depending on whether the DOC was from synthetic wastewater (more lipids and proteins) or real brewery wastewater (more sugars). Consequently, the encapsulation system with coating became diffusion limited when brewery wastewater with high chemical oxygen demand was fed, resulting in a lower hydrogen production rate than the uncoated encapsulation systems. In all cases the encapsulated biomass was able to produce hydrogen, even at a hydraulic residence time of 45 min. Although there are limitations to this system, the used of encapsulated biomass for resource recovery from wastewater shows promise, particularly for high-rate systems in which the retention of specific phenotypes is desired.},
